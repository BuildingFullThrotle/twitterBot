Located to the east of Rio de Janeiro, Cabo Frio is Portuguese for "Cape Cold" ‚Äî so named because the ocean that surrounds it is unusually chilly. Strong northeasterly winds that blow along Cabo Frio's coast push warm surface waters away from the shore, allowing cool water from deeper in the ocean to rise to the surface. This upwelled water is also rich in nutrients, helping feed the rich marine ecosystem off of Cabo Frio's shores.

This image of Cabo Frio was taken from space on September 16, 2023, by the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) instrument aboard Landsat 9, a partnership between NASA and @USGS. June 8 is #WorldOceansDay ‚Äî follow @NASAEarth for more photos from around our home planet!

Every day is #BestFriendsDay for Hubble!

For over three decades, Hubble has collaborated with other missions to get a more complete understanding of our universe.

From collaborating with telescopes like @NASAWebb to helping probes that explore our solar system, Hubble's unique vantage point above our atmosphere and ability to see in ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light have made it a valuable teammate to many missions.

@Boeing‚Äôs Starliner pulls into the orbital driveway of the International Space Station (@ISS) carrying two @NASAAstronauts aboard, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. This is the spacecraft‚Äôs Crew Flight Test, which is testing the end-to-end capabilities of the spacecraft from liftoff to docking and the return to Earth.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
After successfully launching on June 5 at 10:52 a.m. EDT (1452 UTC), the crew docked to the space station on June 6 at 1:34 p.m. EDT (1734 UTC). This was the first time humans have gone to space aboard a @ULAlaunch Atlas V rocket, and the first time astronauts launched on an Atlas-family class rocket since Gordon Cooper on the last Mercury program flight aboard Faith 7 in May 1963. It‚Äôs the same kind of rocket that launched the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers to Mars.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
This is the first time in station history we‚Äôve had three different spacecraft that carried crew to the orbiting lab docked at the same time. Even after more than 25 years of operation, we‚Äôre still experiencing so many exciting firsts. ‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Stay tuned to nasa.gov/live over the next week for broadcast details on the many activities our astronauts will be up to on the orbital lab as they prepare for their return home.‚Å£

‚ÄòSuper‚Äô star cluster shines in new look from NASA‚Äôs Chandra! Westerlund 1 is the biggest and closest ‚Äúsuper‚Äù star cluster to Earth. New data from NASA‚Äôs Chandra X-ray Observatory, in combination with other NASA telescopes, is helping astronomers delve deeper into this galactic factory where stars are vigorously being produced.

This new image shows the new deep Chandra data along with previously released data from NASA‚Äôs Hubble Space Telescope. The X-rays detected by Chandra show young stars (mostly represented as white and pink) as well as diffuse heated gas throughout the cluster (colored pink, green, and blue, in order of increasing temperatures for the gas). Many of the stars picked up by Hubble appear as yellow and blue dots.

Oh, Neptune.

Our Voyager 2 spacecraft captured this image of Neptune‚Äôs south pole as it sped away from the planet in 1989. Here‚Äôs one cool fact about Neptune‚Äôs south pole: it‚Äôs hotter than the rest of the planet by about 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit).

Voyager 2 has been in operation since 1977 and is the only spacecraft to have ever visited Uranus and Neptune. During its travels through the outer solar system, Voyager 2 visited all four gas giant planets, and discovered and photographed many of the planets' moons.

In November 2018, Voyager 2 reached interstellar space, the region between stars filled with material ejected by the death of nearby stars millions of years ago. Its twin spacecraft, Voyager 1, has resided in interstellar space since August 2012. Voyager 1 and 2 are now exploring where nothing from Earth has flown before. In their current mission, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, these two adventurers will explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain.

Forty years ago, a star burst onto the scene as a "nova" ‚Äì and we're still learning more from it.

This nova occurred when a burned-out star ingested gas from a bloated red giant companion that it orbits.

The star system, HM Sagittae, grew 250 times brighter, and has maintained that brightness for decades. However, Hubble's latest observations show that it's gotten hotter, but has paradoxically faded a little.

International Super(nova) Spy üïµÔ∏è

Webb has identified 10 times more supernovae in the early universe than previously known. Several are the most distant examples of their type, including those used to measure the universe's expansion rate.

As the universe expands, light gets stretched into longer (infrared) wavelengths over time. This is called redshift! Because their light has been traveling such great distances, and for so long, Webb‚Äôs powerful and sensitive infrared eye is ideal for observing far-off supernovae.

Before Webb, only a handful of supernovae above a redshift of 2 (corresponding to when the universe was 3.3 billion years old) had been found. Now Webb‚Äôs data sample includes dying stars that exploded when the universe was less than 2 billion years old, in its pre-teens. In total, Webb uncovered ~80 supernovae (circled here in green) in a patch of sky the thickness of a grain of rice held at arm‚Äôs length. Learn more at our link in bio!

Ring ring! @NASAWebb calling üëã

This image of the Southern Ring Nebula was one of the very first that the James Webb Space Telescope shared with the world back in 2022. Officially known as NGC 3132, the Southern Ring Nebula is a cloud of gas and dust surrounding a dying star 2,500 light-years from Earth.

With its high-resolution, infrared vision, Webb is able to peer through the dust to study the glimmering details within. Observations like these are helping astronomers understand the life and death of the stars that make up our galaxy‚Äîand Webb's just getting started.

Image description: A planetary nebula, seen by the Webb telescope's NIRCam instrument, against the blackness of space, with points of starlight behind it. The nebula itself is shaped like an irregular oval, with lacy, reddish orange plumes of gas and dust. Further inside the circle, the gas and dust glows bright blue. A glowing white ring separates the red and blue gases. In the center of the rings are two stars, one glowing much brighter than the other, with diffraction spikes radiating out from it.

NGC 4414 helped light the way! üí°

This dusty spiral galaxy was imaged in the 1990s by Hubble as part of the HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale. Astronomers examined this galaxy with Hubble 13 times over the course of two months, in order to best calculate its distance from Earth.

Based on careful brightness measurements of variable stars (stars that fluctuate in brightness) in NGC 4414, astronomers determined the galaxy is 60 million light-years away.

This information helped scientists understand more about the rate of the expansion of our universe, and teaches us more about the distance and size of many cosmic objects, and even the age of the universe itself.

NGC 4414's central regions contain yellow and red stars that are primarily older, which is common for spiral galaxies. The outer arms are considerably bluer in this #HubbleClassic view due to ongoing formation of young, blue stars.

Image description: A massive spiral galaxy fills the image. With a glowing yellow center, its spiral arms extend outward and are interlaced with dark brown dust  and hazy regions of stars, all against black space.

We heard you like black holes. Well, scientists using Chandra just studied more than 8,000 of them!‚ö´

A new X-ray study of over 8,000 rapidly growing black holes in a sample of 1.3 million galaxies, combined with state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations, has provided us with the best modeling to date of the growth of the supermassive black holes found in the centers of galaxies. More in the comments!

Visual Description:
On the left is an X-ray image from XMM-Newton combined with optical light. Pinpoints of light, mostly in shades of gold, blue, and green, are scattered over the black background of space. One point of blue light, a supermassive black hole, is outlined within an illustrated, gray square. The square has lines protruding to our right that connect it with an artist‚Äôs concept image of a black hole.

The X-ray and optical image on our left, the image containing the square, slowly dissolves as we move toward the right into an image of a supercomputer model of gas density across enormous distances. The model shows a multitude of teal-colored dots and filaments that are converging in some places, forming larger balls of teal-colored light. The patterns appear somewhat similar to the neural networks imaged in the brains of humans and other animals.

The window to the stars let in a particularly pretty pink glow this time!

NGC 3059, a spiral galaxy about 57 million light-years from Earth, was captured by @NASAHubble‚Äôs Wide Field Camera 3, through a narrow-band F657N filter, which focuses mostly on the wavelengths of light that show where pink-hued stars are beginning to form. Stars that emit this pinkish hue, 656.46 nanometers, are typically the younger stars in the galaxy. Using this filter helps astronomers study them.

This particular filter was assisted by five wide-band filters to gather the full spectrum of beauty and color present in this galaxy, while still emphasizing the pinkish stars.

The more filters used to capture an image, the more scientists get to explore any particular observation at different wavelengths, which can yield more observations than a single section of the electromagnetic spectrum captured by one filter in any single image.

The blue pockets, revealed only by the supplementary wide filters, show scientists where older stars may be tucked away in NGC 3059.

Image Description:
A barred spiral galaxy seen face-on. Its many arms and distinct, glowing, bar-shaped core are easily visible. The galaxy‚Äôs arms hold bluish patches of older stars, pink patches where new stars are forming, and dark threads of dust.

‚ÄúEarthrise‚Äù by NASA Astronaut Bill Anders

NASA astronaut Bill Anders took this iconic image of Earth rising over the Moon‚Äôs horizon on Dec. 24, 1968. Anders, lunar module pilot on the Apollo 8 mission, and fellow astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell became the first humans to orbit the Moon and the first to witness the sight pictured.

After becoming a fighter pilot in the Air Force, Anders was selected as an astronaut by NASA. He was backup pilot for the Gemini XI and Apollo 11 flights, and he was lunar module pilot for Apollo 8 ‚Äì the first lunar orbit mission in December 1968. Anders passed away on June 7, 2024.

Planets in progress!

How's this for #ThrowbackThursday? @NASA announced #OTD 30 years ago that Hubble discovered the strongest evidence yet that the planet-making process is common in our Milky Way Galaxy.

Hubble's observations, like the one in this image, reveal huge disks of dust (the raw material for planet formation) swirling around at least half of the stars in the Orion Nebula, a star-forming region only about 1,500 light-years from Earth.

These protoplanetary disks, or proplyds, surround young stars. It's believed our planet Earth, along with the rest of the planets in our solar system, formed in the same way about 4.5 billion years ago.

Thirty years later, astronomers believe that planetary systems like this are common in the universe. And because planets are necessary for life as we know it to become established, this raises the likelihood of the existence of life beyond Earth.

Image description: Hazy, glowing clouds of blue, gray, and pink fill the image. In the foreground, five blobs are protoplanetary disks. The largest is glowing pale orange at center. The others are smaller in size but similar in color, aside from the rightmost blob which is dark brown with a small, bright center.

Sometimes, taking a different route can be a good thing.

See what @NASA‚Äôs Perseverance Mars Rover discovered after changing course to avoid wheel-rattling boulders on its way to an area nicknamed Bright Angel. In crossing the dune field, the rover traversed an unexpected geological playground, Neretva Vallis, which is an ancient river channel that carried the majority of the water that flowed into Jezero Crater billions of years ago.

One particular rock caught the team‚Äôs interest. The light-toned and speckled boulder, nicknamed ‚ÄúAtoko Point,‚Äù is about 18 inches (45 cm) wide and 14 inches (35 cm) tall and stands out in a field of darker ones. Analysis by Perseverance‚Äôs SuperCam and Mastcam-Z instruments indicate that the rock is composed of the minerals pyroxene and feldspar, similar to boulders the rover has encountered elsewhere. But in terms of the size, shape, and arrangement of its mineral grains and crystals ‚Äî and potentially its chemical composition ‚Äî Atoko Point is in a league of its own. Some Perseverance scientists speculate that Atoko Point‚Äôs minerals were produced in a subsurface body of magma that is possibly exposed now on the crater rim. Others on the team wonder if the boulder had been created far beyond the walls of Jezero and transported there by the swift Martian waters eons ago. Either way, the team believes that while Atoko is the first of its kind they‚Äôve seen, it won‚Äôt be the last.

Perseverance is in the later stages of its fourth science campaign, looking for evidence of carbonate deposits in the ‚Äòmargin unit‚Äô along the inside of the crater rim.

Some give their children the world, others give them space. ‚≠ê Our Galileo spacecraft was named for a father of modern astronomy, Galileo Galilei. Galileo was the first mission to measure Jupiter‚Äôs atmosphere directly with a descent probe, and the first to conduct long-term observations of the jovian system from orbit. Galileo orbited Jupiter for almost eight years and made close passes by all its major moons. It found evidence of subsurface liquid layers of saltwater on Europa, Ganymede and Callisto and it examined a diversity of volcanic activity on Io. Its camera and nine other instruments sent back reports that allowed scientists to determine, among other things, that Jupiter‚Äôs icy moon Europa probably has a subsurface ocean with more water than the total amount found on Earth. They discovered that the volcanoes of the moon Io repeatedly and rapidly resurface the little world. They found that the giant moon Ganymede possesses its own magnetic field. Galileo even carried a small probe that it deployed and sent deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, taking readings for almost an hour before the probe was crushed by overwhelming pressure. Image description: A portion of Jupiter‚Äôs moon Ganymede is pictured in black-and-white.

California teams win $1.5 million in NASA‚Äôs Break the Ice Lunar Challenge! After two days of live competitions, two teams from southern California are heading home with a combined $1.5 million from NASA‚Äôs Break the Ice Lunar Challenge. Since 2020, competitors from around the world have competed in this challenge with the common goal of inventing robots that can excavate and transport the icy regolith on the Moon. The lunar South Pole is the targeted landing site for crewed Artemis missions, so utilizing all resources in that area, including the ice within the dusty regolith inside the permanently shadowed regions, is vital for the success of a sustained human lunar presence.

In this image, the husband-and-wife duo of Terra Engineering, Valerie and Todd Mendenhall, receive the $1 million prize Wednesday, June 12, for winning the final phase of NASA‚Äôs Break the Ice Lunar Challenge at Alabama A&M‚Äôs Agribition Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

Webb is cracking open the Crab Nebula to help scientists figure out what is inside. ü¶Ä

The Crab is the remnant of what was once a massive star, but it‚Äôs highly unusual in composition, making scientists think its star might not have been typical either. Webb also mapped light emitted from the dust in the Crab Nebula in high resolution for the first time. Unlike other supernova remnants, which have dust concentrated at their centers, the Crab Nebula‚Äôs dust is found in the outer shell‚Äôs dense filaments. Read more at the link in our bio.

Image description: The Crab Nebula. An oval with complex structure extends from lower left to upper right against a black background. On the oval‚Äôs exterior lie curtains of glowing yellow and green fluffy material. Its interior shell shows large-scale loops of mottled filaments of yellow-white and green, studded with clumps and knots. Translucent thin ribbons of smoky blue lie within the remnant‚Äôs interior, brightest toward its center. The blue material follows different directions throughout, including sometimes sharply curving away from certain regions within the remnant. A faint, wispy ring of blue material encircles the very center of the nebula. Around and within the supernova remnant are many points of blue, green, purple, and white light.
