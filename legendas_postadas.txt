Located to the east of Rio de Janeiro, Cabo Frio is Portuguese for "Cape Cold" ‚Äî so named because the ocean that surrounds it is unusually chilly. Strong northeasterly winds that blow along Cabo Frio's coast push warm surface waters away from the shore, allowing cool water from deeper in the ocean to rise to the surface. This upwelled water is also rich in nutrients, helping feed the rich marine ecosystem off of Cabo Frio's shores.

This image of Cabo Frio was taken from space on September 16, 2023, by the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) instrument aboard Landsat 9, a partnership between NASA and @USGS. June 8 is #WorldOceansDay ‚Äî follow @NASAEarth for more photos from around our home planet!

Every day is #BestFriendsDay for Hubble!

For over three decades, Hubble has collaborated with other missions to get a more complete understanding of our universe.

From collaborating with telescopes like @NASAWebb to helping probes that explore our solar system, Hubble's unique vantage point above our atmosphere and ability to see in ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light have made it a valuable teammate to many missions.

@Boeing‚Äôs Starliner pulls into the orbital driveway of the International Space Station (@ISS) carrying two @NASAAstronauts aboard, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. This is the spacecraft‚Äôs Crew Flight Test, which is testing the end-to-end capabilities of the spacecraft from liftoff to docking and the return to Earth.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
After successfully launching on June 5 at 10:52 a.m. EDT (1452 UTC), the crew docked to the space station on June 6 at 1:34 p.m. EDT (1734 UTC). This was the first time humans have gone to space aboard a @ULAlaunch Atlas V rocket, and the first time astronauts launched on an Atlas-family class rocket since Gordon Cooper on the last Mercury program flight aboard Faith 7 in May 1963. It‚Äôs the same kind of rocket that launched the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers to Mars.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
This is the first time in station history we‚Äôve had three different spacecraft that carried crew to the orbiting lab docked at the same time. Even after more than 25 years of operation, we‚Äôre still experiencing so many exciting firsts. ‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Stay tuned to nasa.gov/live over the next week for broadcast details on the many activities our astronauts will be up to on the orbital lab as they prepare for their return home.‚Å£

‚ÄòSuper‚Äô star cluster shines in new look from NASA‚Äôs Chandra! Westerlund 1 is the biggest and closest ‚Äúsuper‚Äù star cluster to Earth. New data from NASA‚Äôs Chandra X-ray Observatory, in combination with other NASA telescopes, is helping astronomers delve deeper into this galactic factory where stars are vigorously being produced.

This new image shows the new deep Chandra data along with previously released data from NASA‚Äôs Hubble Space Telescope. The X-rays detected by Chandra show young stars (mostly represented as white and pink) as well as diffuse heated gas throughout the cluster (colored pink, green, and blue, in order of increasing temperatures for the gas). Many of the stars picked up by Hubble appear as yellow and blue dots.

Oh, Neptune.

Our Voyager 2 spacecraft captured this image of Neptune‚Äôs south pole as it sped away from the planet in 1989. Here‚Äôs one cool fact about Neptune‚Äôs south pole: it‚Äôs hotter than the rest of the planet by about 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit).

Voyager 2 has been in operation since 1977 and is the only spacecraft to have ever visited Uranus and Neptune. During its travels through the outer solar system, Voyager 2 visited all four gas giant planets, and discovered and photographed many of the planets' moons.

In November 2018, Voyager 2 reached interstellar space, the region between stars filled with material ejected by the death of nearby stars millions of years ago. Its twin spacecraft, Voyager 1, has resided in interstellar space since August 2012. Voyager 1 and 2 are now exploring where nothing from Earth has flown before. In their current mission, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, these two adventurers will explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain.

Forty years ago, a star burst onto the scene as a "nova" ‚Äì and we're still learning more from it.

This nova occurred when a burned-out star ingested gas from a bloated red giant companion that it orbits.

The star system, HM Sagittae, grew 250 times brighter, and has maintained that brightness for decades. However, Hubble's latest observations show that it's gotten hotter, but has paradoxically faded a little.

International Super(nova) Spy üïµÔ∏è

Webb has identified 10 times more supernovae in the early universe than previously known. Several are the most distant examples of their type, including those used to measure the universe's expansion rate.

As the universe expands, light gets stretched into longer (infrared) wavelengths over time. This is called redshift! Because their light has been traveling such great distances, and for so long, Webb‚Äôs powerful and sensitive infrared eye is ideal for observing far-off supernovae.

Before Webb, only a handful of supernovae above a redshift of 2 (corresponding to when the universe was 3.3 billion years old) had been found. Now Webb‚Äôs data sample includes dying stars that exploded when the universe was less than 2 billion years old, in its pre-teens. In total, Webb uncovered ~80 supernovae (circled here in green) in a patch of sky the thickness of a grain of rice held at arm‚Äôs length. Learn more at our link in bio!

Ring ring! @NASAWebb calling üëã

This image of the Southern Ring Nebula was one of the very first that the James Webb Space Telescope shared with the world back in 2022. Officially known as NGC 3132, the Southern Ring Nebula is a cloud of gas and dust surrounding a dying star 2,500 light-years from Earth.

With its high-resolution, infrared vision, Webb is able to peer through the dust to study the glimmering details within. Observations like these are helping astronomers understand the life and death of the stars that make up our galaxy‚Äîand Webb's just getting started.

Image description: A planetary nebula, seen by the Webb telescope's NIRCam instrument, against the blackness of space, with points of starlight behind it. The nebula itself is shaped like an irregular oval, with lacy, reddish orange plumes of gas and dust. Further inside the circle, the gas and dust glows bright blue. A glowing white ring separates the red and blue gases. In the center of the rings are two stars, one glowing much brighter than the other, with diffraction spikes radiating out from it.

NGC 4414 helped light the way! üí°

This dusty spiral galaxy was imaged in the 1990s by Hubble as part of the HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale. Astronomers examined this galaxy with Hubble 13 times over the course of two months, in order to best calculate its distance from Earth.

Based on careful brightness measurements of variable stars (stars that fluctuate in brightness) in NGC 4414, astronomers determined the galaxy is 60 million light-years away.

This information helped scientists understand more about the rate of the expansion of our universe, and teaches us more about the distance and size of many cosmic objects, and even the age of the universe itself.

NGC 4414's central regions contain yellow and red stars that are primarily older, which is common for spiral galaxies. The outer arms are considerably bluer in this #HubbleClassic view due to ongoing formation of young, blue stars.

Image description: A massive spiral galaxy fills the image. With a glowing yellow center, its spiral arms extend outward and are interlaced with dark brown dust  and hazy regions of stars, all against black space.

We heard you like black holes. Well, scientists using Chandra just studied more than 8,000 of them!‚ö´

A new X-ray study of over 8,000 rapidly growing black holes in a sample of 1.3 million galaxies, combined with state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations, has provided us with the best modeling to date of the growth of the supermassive black holes found in the centers of galaxies. More in the comments!

Visual Description:
On the left is an X-ray image from XMM-Newton combined with optical light. Pinpoints of light, mostly in shades of gold, blue, and green, are scattered over the black background of space. One point of blue light, a supermassive black hole, is outlined within an illustrated, gray square. The square has lines protruding to our right that connect it with an artist‚Äôs concept image of a black hole.

The X-ray and optical image on our left, the image containing the square, slowly dissolves as we move toward the right into an image of a supercomputer model of gas density across enormous distances. The model shows a multitude of teal-colored dots and filaments that are converging in some places, forming larger balls of teal-colored light. The patterns appear somewhat similar to the neural networks imaged in the brains of humans and other animals.

The window to the stars let in a particularly pretty pink glow this time!

NGC 3059, a spiral galaxy about 57 million light-years from Earth, was captured by @NASAHubble‚Äôs Wide Field Camera 3, through a narrow-band F657N filter, which focuses mostly on the wavelengths of light that show where pink-hued stars are beginning to form. Stars that emit this pinkish hue, 656.46 nanometers, are typically the younger stars in the galaxy. Using this filter helps astronomers study them.

This particular filter was assisted by five wide-band filters to gather the full spectrum of beauty and color present in this galaxy, while still emphasizing the pinkish stars.

The more filters used to capture an image, the more scientists get to explore any particular observation at different wavelengths, which can yield more observations than a single section of the electromagnetic spectrum captured by one filter in any single image.

The blue pockets, revealed only by the supplementary wide filters, show scientists where older stars may be tucked away in NGC 3059.

Image Description:
A barred spiral galaxy seen face-on. Its many arms and distinct, glowing, bar-shaped core are easily visible. The galaxy‚Äôs arms hold bluish patches of older stars, pink patches where new stars are forming, and dark threads of dust.

NASA astronaut Bill Anders took this iconic image of Earth rising over the Moon‚Äôs horizon on Dec. 24, 1968. Anders, lunar module pilot on the Apollo 8 mission, and fellow astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell became the first humans to orbit the Moon and the first to witness the sight pictured.

After becoming a fighter pilot in the Air Force, Anders was selected as an astronaut by NASA. He was backup pilot for the Gemini XI and Apollo 11 flights, and he was lunar module pilot for Apollo 8 ‚Äì the first lunar orbit mission in December 1968. Anders passed away on June 7, 2024.

Planets in progress!

How's this for #ThrowbackThursday? @NASA announced #OTD 30 years ago that Hubble discovered the strongest evidence yet that the planet-making process is common in our Milky Way Galaxy.

Hubble's observations, like the one in this image, reveal huge disks of dust (the raw material for planet formation) swirling around at least half of the stars in the Orion Nebula, a star-forming region only about 1,500 light-years from Earth.

These protoplanetary disks, or proplyds, surround young stars. It's believed our planet Earth, along with the rest of the planets in our solar system, formed in the same way about 4.5 billion years ago.

Thirty years later, astronomers believe that planetary systems like this are common in the universe. And because planets are necessary for life as we know it to become established, this raises the likelihood of the existence of life beyond Earth.

Image description: Hazy, glowing clouds of blue, gray, and pink fill the image. In the foreground, five blobs are protoplanetary disks. The largest is glowing pale orange at center. The others are smaller in size but similar in color, aside from the rightmost blob which is dark brown with a small, bright center.

Sometimes, taking a different route can be a good thing.

See what @NASA‚Äôs Perseverance Mars Rover discovered after changing course to avoid wheel-rattling boulders on its way to an area nicknamed Bright Angel. In crossing the dune field, the rover traversed an unexpected geological playground, Neretva Vallis, which is an ancient river channel that carried the majority of the water that flowed into Jezero Crater billions of years ago.

One particular rock caught the team‚Äôs interest. The light-toned and speckled boulder, nicknamed ‚ÄúAtoko Point,‚Äù is about 18 inches (45 cm) wide and 14 inches (35 cm) tall and stands out in a field of darker ones. Analysis by Perseverance‚Äôs SuperCam and Mastcam-Z instruments indicate that the rock is composed of the minerals pyroxene and feldspar, similar to boulders the rover has encountered elsewhere. But in terms of the size, shape, and arrangement of its mineral grains and crystals ‚Äî and potentially its chemical composition ‚Äî Atoko Point is in a league of its own. Some Perseverance scientists speculate that Atoko Point‚Äôs minerals were produced in a subsurface body of magma that is possibly exposed now on the crater rim. Others on the team wonder if the boulder had been created far beyond the walls of Jezero and transported there by the swift Martian waters eons ago. Either way, the team believes that while Atoko is the first of its kind they‚Äôve seen, it won‚Äôt be the last.

Perseverance is in the later stages of its fourth science campaign, looking for evidence of carbonate deposits in the ‚Äòmargin unit‚Äô along the inside of the crater rim.

Some give their children the world, others give them space. ‚≠ê Our Galileo spacecraft was named for a father of modern astronomy, Galileo Galilei. Galileo was the first mission to measure Jupiter‚Äôs atmosphere directly with a descent probe, and the first to conduct long-term observations of the jovian system from orbit. Galileo orbited Jupiter for almost eight years and made close passes by all its major moons. It found evidence of subsurface liquid layers of saltwater on Europa, Ganymede and Callisto and it examined a diversity of volcanic activity on Io. Its camera and nine other instruments sent back reports that allowed scientists to determine, among other things, that Jupiter‚Äôs icy moon Europa probably has a subsurface ocean with more water than the total amount found on Earth. They discovered that the volcanoes of the moon Io repeatedly and rapidly resurface the little world. They found that the giant moon Ganymede possesses its own magnetic field. Galileo even carried a small probe that it deployed and sent deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, taking readings for almost an hour before the probe was crushed by overwhelming pressure. Image description: A portion of Jupiter‚Äôs moon Ganymede is pictured in black-and-white.

On the oval‚Äôs exterior lie curtains of glowing yellow and green fluffy material. Its interior shell shows large-scale loops of mottled filaments of yellow-white and green, studded with clumps and knots. Translucent thin ribbons of smoky blue lie within the remnant‚Äôs interior, brightest toward its center. The blue material follows different directions throughout, including sometimes sharply curving away from certain regions within the remnant. A faint, wispy ring of blue material encircles the very center of the nebula. Around and within the supernova remnant are many points of blue, green, purple, and white light.

President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, but news did not reach Confederate-controlled Galveston until April 1865, when Union troops arrived to inform the people of Texas that all enslaved people were free. As news of General Order No. 3 (issued June 19) spread, spontaneous celebrations broke out in African American churches, homes, and other gathering places. Over time, these June 19th celebrations became more formalized, becoming annual Juneteenth celebrations.

The stars, they aligned üé∂
¬†
See how those bright red, clumpy streaks in the top left are all slanted in the same direction to the same degree? They show aligned protostellar outflows, or jets of gas from newborn stars. @NASAWebb captures this phenomenon for the first time.
¬†
‚ÄúAstronomers have long assumed that as clouds collapse to form stars, the stars will tend to spin in the same direction,‚Äù said principal investigator Klaus Pontoppidan of @NASAJPL. ‚ÄúHowever, this has not been seen so directly before. These aligned, elongated structures are a historical record of the fundamental way that stars are born.‚Äù
¬†
Previously, the objects appeared as blobs or were invisible in optical wavelengths. Webb‚Äôs sensitive infrared vision was able to pierce through the thick dust, resolving the stars and their outflows.
¬†
This area is part of the Serpens Nebula. Located 1,300 light-years from Earth, it‚Äôs only 1-2 million years old ‚Äî very young in cosmic terms! It‚Äôs home to a dense cluster of newly forming stars (about 100,000 years old), seen at the center of this image.

Surrounding the octopus-like structure is a cloud of material in shades of red that is wider horizontally than it is vertically. A ribbon of purple material extends to the left edge of the red cloud, curling upward at its conclusion. Another purple ribbon extends to the right edge of the red cloud, though it is less defined than the one on the other side. Stars of many shapes and sizes dot the entire image.

The stars, they aligned üé∂
¬†
See how those bright red, clumpy streaks in the top left are all slanted in the same direction to the same degree? They show aligned protostellar outflows, or jets of gas from newborn stars. @NASAWebb captures this phenomenon for the first time.
¬†
‚ÄúAstronomers have long assumed that as clouds collapse to form stars, the stars will tend to spin in the same direction,‚Äù said principal investigator Klaus Pontoppidan of @NASAJPL. ‚ÄúHowever, this has not been seen so directly before. These aligned, elongated structures are a historical record of the fundamental way that stars are born.‚Äù
¬†
Previously, the objects appeared as blobs or were invisible in optical wavelengths. Webb‚Äôs sensitive infrared vision was able to pierce through the thick dust, resolving the stars and their outflows.
¬†
This area is part of the Serpens Nebula. Located 1,300 light-years from Earth, it‚Äôs only 1-2 million years old ‚Äî very young in cosmic terms! It‚Äôs home to a dense cluster of newly forming stars (about 100,000 years old), seen at the center of this image.

Image description: A young star-forming region is filled with wispy orange, red, and blue layers of gas and dust. The upper left corner of the image is filled with mostly orange dust, and within that orange dust, there are several small red plumes of gas that extend from the top left to the bottom right, at the same angle. The center of the image is filled with mostly blue gas. At the center, there is one particularly bright star, that has an hourglass shadow above and below it. To the right of that is what looks a vertical eye-shaped crevice with a bright star at the center. The gas to the right of the crevice is a darker orange. Small points of light are sprinkled across the field, brightest sources in the field have extensive eight-pointed diffraction spikes that are characteristic of the Webb Telescope.

Top of Solstice ü™ê 

It's Earth's solstice today, but Saturn's Northern Hemisphere reached its summer solstice in mid-2017, bringing continuous sunshine to the planet's far north. The Cassini mission used the unparalleled opportunity to observe changes that occur on the planet as the Saturnian seasons turn.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 17 degrees above the ring plane. The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 17, 2017 using a spectral filter which preferentially admits wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 939 nanometers.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 733,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Saturn. Image scale is 44 miles (70 kilometers) per pixel.

NASA‚Äôs Chandra peers into densest and weirdest stars! The supernova remnant 3C 58 contains a spinning neutron star, known as PSR J0205+6449, at its center. Astronomers studied this neutron star and others like it to probe the nature of matter inside these very dense objects. A new study, made using NASA‚Äôs Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESA‚Äôs XMM-Newton, reveals that the interiors of neutron stars may contain a type of ultra-dense matter not found anywhere else in the Universe.

In this image of 3C 58, low-energy X-rays are colored red, medium-energy X-rays are green, and the high-energy band of X-rays is shown in blue. The X-ray data have been combined with an optical image in yellow from the Digitized Sky Survey. The Chandra data show that the rapidly rotating neutron star (also known as a ‚Äúpulsar‚Äù) at the center is surrounded by a torus of X-ray emission and a jet that extends for several light-years. The optical data shows stars in the field.

Phobos is the larger of Mars' two moons‚Äîbut it's still only about 17 x 14 x 11 miles (27 by 22 by 18 kilometers) in diameter. Because Phobos is so small, its gravity isn't strong enough to pull it into a sphere (like Earth's Moon), giving it its lumpy shape.

Phobos is also on a collision course with Mars‚Äîthough it'll take a while to get there. It's nearing the Red Planet at a rate of six feet (1.8 meters) every hundred years. At that rate, the moon will either crash into Mars in 50 million years or break up into a ring. 

This image was taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on our Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been studying Mars since 2006.

Image description: The Martian moon Phobos stands against the darkness of space. The moon is brownish-red and lumpy, pocketed with a number of craters of all sizes. A white patch is visible next to Stickney crater, a particularly large crater on its right side.

Cloudy with a chance of new stars! üåü

Named RCW 7, the nebula in this #HubbleFriday view contains the gas and dust needed to form stars. Under the influence of gravity, parts of the nebula's clouds collapse until they coalesce into very young, developing stars ‚Äì called protostars!

The protostars in RCW 7 are huge, giving off fierce stellar winds and radiation that are transforming the nebula into something called a H II region.

These regions are full of hydrogen ions. Ultraviolet radiation from the massive protostars excites the hydrogen in the nebula, causing it to emit light.

RCW 7 is located about 5,300 light-years away in the constellation Puppis. Find out more at the link in our bio!

Image description: Clouds of gas and dust with many stars. The clouds form a flat, blue background toward the bottom, and become thicker and smokier toward the top. Stars on one side light the nebula. A thick arc of gas and dust reaches around from the bottom-right corner of the image toward the top-left corner. It begins as a dark and obscuring cloud at bottom right and gradually becomes brightly lit by many stars at the upper left. Other large, foreground stars lie between the nebula and the viewer.

We‚Äôre investigating the origins of the Crab Nebula üîç

Scientists used @NASAWebb to explore what makes up the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant located 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Taurus. 

The Crab Nebula is rare, and researchers previously believed it had formed from a core made of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, rather than the more common iron core. However, Webb‚Äôs new data offers new interpretations of how this nebula came to be.

Image Description:
The Crab Nebula. An oval with a complex structure extends from lower left to upper right against a black background. On the oval‚Äôs exterior lie curtains of glowing yellow and green fluffy material. Its interior shell shows large-scale loops with mottled filaments of yellow-white and green, studded with clumps and knots. Translucent thin ribbons of smoky blue lie within the Crab Nebula‚Äôs interior, brightest toward its center. The blue material follows different directions throughout, including sometimes sharply curving away from certain regions. A faint, wispy ring of blue material encircles the very center of the nebula. Around and within the supernova remnant are many points of blue, green, purple, and white light.

First of its kind detection made in striking new Webb image! In this image of the Serpens Nebula from NASA‚Äôs James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers found a grouping of aligned protostellar outflows within one small region (the top left corner). Serpens is a reflection nebula, which means it‚Äôs a cloud of gas and dust that does not create its own light, but instead shines by reflecting the light from stars close to or within the nebula.

This sea ice is taking a spin down the coast üåä

Floating fragments of sea ice formed intricate patterns as ocean currents carried them south along Greenland‚Äôs east coast in spring 2024. 

Captured on June 4, this movement of sea ice and freshwater out of the Arctic is a component of ocean circulation patterns that distribute heat around the planet. The so-called ‚Äúglobal ocean conveyor belt‚Äù transports cold water south and warm water north, contributing to climate conditions worldwide. Sea ice has been declining in recent decades, affecting its ability to cool the planet.

Image Description:
A satellite image of Greenland‚Äôs east coast shows white floating fragments of sea ice spun into intricate swirls against a midnight blue ocean. Larger floes appear closer to the shoreline. Fast ice, which is ice anchored to the shore or shallow ocean bottom, is visible at the top of the image and along other sections of the coast. Along the upper left edge of the image, Greenland is visible, with brown rocks peeking through white snow.

Rhapsody in blue üé∂

This cosmic nebula, a cloud of gas and dust where new stars are born, was spotted by our orbiting @NASAHubble telescope. Located just over 5,300 light-years from Earth, this nebula is home to a number of young, developing stars called protostars, which show up as some of the smaller sparkles in this image.

The Hubble data in this image came from the telescope's Wide Field Camera 3, which peered through the nebula's cocoon of gas with near-infrared vision to study the stars within. This particular nebula is rich with hydrogen ions which are excited by the ultraviolet radiation coming from the nebula's protostars, giving it the pinkish glow seen here.

Image description: A dreamlike stellar landscape, with a pinkish arc of gas standing out against dark blue swirls. A number of stars of various sizes, each accentuated by four diffraction spikes, are abundantly scattered through the image.

This nebula‚Äôs baby stars may spell its rapid end‚Ä¶in a few million years.

The nebula RCW 7 is a collection of gas and dust that appears within the Puppis constellation. Parts of this star-forming nebula, or molecular cloud, have collapsed under gravity and formed into very young, developing stars known as protostars. RCW 7‚Äôs protostars are very massive, and give off strongly ionizing radiation and fierce stellar winds that have transformed the nebula into something called a H II region.

Captured in this photo by @NasaHubble, these new stars emit ultraviolet radiation that excites the hydrogen clouds in the nebula, causing the emission of pinkish light.

The formation of an H II region marks the beginning of the end for a molecular cloud like RCW 7. Within only a few million years, radiation and winds from the massive stars will gradually disperse the nebula‚Äôs gas ‚Äî even more so as the most massive stars come to the end of their lives in supernova explosions. New stars in this nebula will incorporate only a fraction of the nebula‚Äôs gas, the rest will spread throughout the galaxy to eventually form new molecular clouds.

The Hubble data in this image came from the study of a particularly massive protostellar binary named IRAS 07299-1651, still in its glowing cocoon of gas in the curling clouds toward the top of the image. To expose this star and its siblings, astronomers used Hubble‚Äôs Wide Field Camera 3 in near-infrared light.

Image Description

Clouds of gas and dust with many stars. The clouds form a flat, blue background toward the bottom, and become thicker and smokier toward the top. Stars on one side light the nebula. A thick arc of gas and dust reaches around from the bottom-right corner of the image toward the top-left corner. It begins as a dark and obscuring cloud at bottom right and gradually becomes brightly lit by many stars at the upper left. Other large, foreground stars lie between the nebula and the viewer.

Hubble views the lights of a galactic bar! This image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows the broad and sweeping spiral galaxy NGC 4731. It lies in the constellation Virgo and is located 43 million light-years from Earth. This highly detailed image uses data collected from six different filters. The abundance of color illustrates the galaxy's billowing clouds of gas, dark dust bands, bright pink star-forming regions and, most obviously, the long, glowing bar with trailing arms.

Barred spiral galaxies outnumber both regular spirals and elliptical galaxies put together, numbering around 60% of all galaxies. The visible bar structure is a result of orbits of stars and gas in the galaxy lining up, forming a dense region that individual stars move in and out of over time. This is the same process that maintains a galaxy's spiral arms, but it is somewhat more mysterious for bars: spiral galaxies seem to form bars in their centers as they mature, which helps explain the large number of bars we see today, but they can also lose them if the accumulated mass along the bar grows unstable.

@nasa successfully launched the fourth and final satellite in a series of advanced weather satellites for @noaa (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) at 4:26 p.m. CDT Tuesday, June 25. The GOES-U (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) will benefit the nation by providing continuous coverage of weather and hazardous environmental conditions across much of the Western Hemisphere.

The satellite launched on a @spacex Falcon Heavy rocket from Launch Complex 39A at @nasakennedy in Florida. Mission managers confirmed at 9:18 p.m. CDT on June 25 the spacecraft‚Äôs solar arrays successfully deployed, and the spacecraft was operating on its own power.

In addition to its critical role in terrestrial weather prediction, the GOES constellation of satellites helps forecasters predict space weather near Earth that can interfere with satellite electronics, GPS, and radio communications. The GOES-U satellite goes beyond the capabilities of its predecessors with a new space weather instrument, the Compact Coronograph-1, which blocks the Sun‚Äôs bright light so scientists can observe the relatively fainter solar atmosphere.

Once GOES-U is in a geostationary orbit, about 22,200 miles above Earth, it will be renamed GOES-19. Following a successful orbital checkout of its instruments and systems, GOES-19 will go into service, keeping watch of the weather over most of North America, including the contiguous United States and Mexico, as well as Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west coast of Africa.

@nasagoddard in Greenbelt, Maryland, oversaw the acquisition of the GOES-R series spacecraft and instruments and built the magnetometer for GOES-U and its predecessor, GOES-T. NASA‚Äôs Launch Services Program, based at Kennedy, provided launch management for the mission.

The GOES-R Series Program is overseen by NOAA, through an integrated NOAA-NASA office that manages the ground system, operates the satellites, and distributes data to users worldwide. @lockheedmartin designs, builds, and tests the GOES-R series satellites. @l3harristech provides the main instrument payload, the Advanced Baseline Imager, and the ground system.

Go with the floe üßä

These swirling ice floes are spinning off the shore of Greenland, as seen in this photo taken from space on June 4, 2024. Sea ice from the Arctic drifts down the Fram Strait, a 450-kilometer (280-mile)-wide passage that connects the Arctic Ocean with the Greenland Sea. Along the way, it breaks into smaller pieces and starts to melt in warmer ocean waters, creating the smoke-like swirls seen here.

In recent years, more of the Arctic Ocean's sea ice has become too young and thin to make the journey south. The movement of sea ice and freshwater out of the Arctic is part of the ocean circulation patterns that distribute heat around the planet, contributing to climate conditions worldwide ‚Äî so scientists are keeping a close eye on how these floes flow.

Follow @NASAEarth for more updates from across our home planet.

You‚Äôre the sunflower üéµ

Millions of light-years away in the small, northern constellation Canes Venatici, the spiral Sunflower galaxy (Messier 63) spreads its many arms ‚Äì or so it seems. The Sunflower galaxy is a flocculent spiral galaxy. That means its spiral arms aren‚Äôt well defined, so it looks like there are many that appear to be winding around its yellow core. In reality, there are just two. The arms shine bright thanks to recently formed, blue‚Äìwhite giant stars.

Star formation is one of the most important processes in shaping the universe. In addition to birthing new stars, it gives rise to planetary systems and plays a pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies. Scientists don‚Äôt fully know how stars form in flocculent spiral galaxies, so Messier 63 is a perfect one to study with images like this one from @nasahubble.

Image description: Slightly right of center, the galaxy‚Äôs core glows in yellow. The galaxy‚Äôs arms spiral outward from the core, filling the image with blue-tinged gas and dust. There are bright blue dots studded throughout these spiral arms; these are young blue-white giant stars. Very little of the darkness of space can be seen in this image, except at the very bottom.

NASA‚Äôs Mars Odyssey captures huge volcano, nears 100,000 orbits! NASA‚Äôs longest-lived Mars robot is about to mark a new milestone on June 30: 100,000 trips around the Red Planet since launching 23 years ago. During that time, the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter has been mapping minerals and ice across the Martian surface, identifying landing sites for future missions, and relaying data to Earth from NASA‚Äôs rovers and landers.

Scientists recently used the orbiter‚Äôs camera to take a stunning new image of Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system. The image is part of a continuing effort by the Odyssey team to provide high-altitude views of the planet‚Äôs horizon. (The first of these views was published in late 2023.) Similar to the perspective of Earth astronauts get aboard the International Space Station, the view enables scientists to learn more about clouds and airborne dust at Mars.

Surprising phosphate finding in NASA‚Äôs OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample! Early analysis of the asteroid Bennu sample returned by NASA‚Äôs OSIRIS-REx mission has revealed dust rich in carbon, nitrogen, and organic compounds, all of which are essential components for life as we know it. Dominated by clay minerals, particularly serpentine, the sample mirrors the type of rock found at mid-ocean ridges on Earth. The magnesium-sodium phosphate found in the sample hints that the asteroid could have splintered off from an ancient, small, primitive ocean world. The phosphate was a surprise to the team because the mineral had not been detected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft while at Bennu.

In this image, a tiny fraction of the asteroid Bennu sample returned by NASA‚Äôs OSIRIS-REx mission, is shown in microscope images. The top-left pane shows a dark Bennu particle, about a millimeter long, with an outer crust of bright phosphate. The other three panels show progressively zoomed-in views of a fragment of the particle that split off along a bright vein containing phosphate, captured by a scanning electron microscope.

Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen.

JPL scientists tracked two asteroids as they safely flew past Earth recently ‚Äì one of them even had an unexpected moonlet! Scientists used the Deep Space Network‚Äôs 230-foot-wide (70m) Goldstone Solar System Radar, called Deep Space Station 14 (DSS-14) near Barstow, California to transmit radio waves to the asteroids and received the reflected signals by the same antenna. The radar observations of these close approaches will provide valuable information about their sizes, orbits, rotation, surface details, and clues as to their composition and formation.

Asteroid 2011 UL21 passed Earth on June 27 at about 4 million miles, or 17 times the distance between the Moon and Earth. The well-known asteroid is nearly a mile (about 1.5 km) wide. It was discovered in 2011 by the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey, but this is the first time it has come close enough to Earth to be imaged by radar. Along with seeing that the asteroid is roughly spherical object, JPL scientists discovered that it has a smaller asteroid, or moonlet, orbiting it about 1.9 miles (3 km) away.

Two days later, on June 29, the same team observed the asteroid 2024 MK make a close approach, passing our planet at about 184,000 miles (295,000 km). About 500 feet (150 m) wide, the asteroid appears to be elongated and angular, with prominent flat and rounded regions. Such close approaches of near-Earth objects the size of 2024 MK are relatively rare, occurring about every couple of decades.

While both asteroids are classified as a potentially hazardous object, calculations of their future orbits show that they won‚Äôt pose a threat to our planet for the foreseeable future.

Cosmic fireworks in time for the Fourth of July‚Å£
‚Å£
A fiery hourglass marks this cosmic object that‚Äôs turning into a star. @NASAWebb‚Äôs Mid-Infrared Instrument spotted this protostar 460 light-years from Earth in the constellation Taurus.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
A protostar is a collection of interstellar gas and dust, whose gravitational pull is causing it to collapse on itself and form a star. This protostar is growing in the neck of the hourglass, accumulating material from a thin protoplanetary disk, seen edge-on here as a dark line.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Just in time for the Fourth of July, the protostar is decked out in red, white, and blue‚Äîadapted from Webb‚Äôs infrared vision. The more diffuse blue light and the filament-like structures in the image come from organic compounds known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), while the red at the center of this image is an energized, thick layer of gas and dust that surrounds the protostar. The region in between, which shows up in white, is a mixture of PAHs, ionized gas, and other molecules.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: A growing protostar embedded within a molecular cloud. The center of the image shows a bright, red region, where the protostar resides, with a thin, gray lane cutting through it horizontally, which is the protostar‚Äôs accretion disk. Above and below this region are white and blue triangular-shaped cavities in the molecular cloud, which give the overall object an hourglass shape. The areas of the cavities closest to the central protostar have more pronounced plumes of white gas and dust that fade to a blue color further from the center. There are red, yellow, orange, blue, and green stars and galaxies scattered across the image.‚Å£

Some stellar fireworks for #FourthOfJuly ‚≠ê

Astronomers used @NASAWebb to directly image the Serpens Nebula, a young, star-forming region. The top left area of the image shows jets of gas from newborn stars colliding with nearby gas and dust at high speeds. These outflows are all slanted in the same direction, a previously uncaptured phenomenon. 

This image indicates that as clouds collapse to form stars, the stars will tend to spin in the same direction. 

Image description:
A young star-forming region is filled with wispy orange, red, and blue layers of gas and dust. The upper left corner of the image is filled with an orange and red mixture of gas and dust, created from gas lighting up as the jets plow into the surrounding cloud. At the center, there is one particularly bright star that has an hourglass shadow above and below it. To the right of that is what looks like a vertical eye-shaped crevice with a bright star at the center. The gas to the right of the crevice is a darker orange. The center of the image is filled with blue wisps, created as light from the bright star in the center of the large shadow is reflected on small dust grains. Small points of light are sprinkled across the field; the brightest sources in the field have extensive eight-pointed diffraction spikes that are characteristic of the Webb Telescope.

Some people want all the attention üôÑ

While capturing an image of galaxy NGC 7250, our @nasahubble telescope also saw a moment of stellar upstaging ‚Äì a single star stealing the show.

Both the star and the galaxy are in the constellation Lacerta (The Lizard), but the star is a million times closer to us than the galaxy, which lies more than 45 million light-years away. This relative closeness is the only way a star can outshine an entire galaxy containing billions of stars.

This star is what astronomers call a ‚Äúforeground star,‚Äù and it‚Äôs a bit of a nuisance. Its light can contaminate fainter light from more distant objects that astronomers want to study.

Then again, foreground stars aren‚Äôt all bad. In a technique called microlensing, the gravitational pull of a foreground star can be used to amplify the light of a background star that momentarily aligned with it. The exact timing and amount of light amplification can reveal clues to the nature of the foreground star and its accompanying planets.

Image description: Amid a backdrop of galaxies, a star shines brightly with a white-yellow light, slightly left of center. The star has eight long spikes, which are imaging artifacts called diffraction spikes. To the right of the star is a galaxy; clouds of gas and dust can be seen along with stars. Some of the galaxy shines with a bluish light. Dotted all around the rest of the dark background of space are other galaxies and stars.

A team of scientists used NASA‚Äôs James Webb Space Telescope to parse the composition of the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant located 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Taurus. With the telescope‚Äôs MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) and NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera), the team gathered data that is helping to clarify the Crab Nebula‚Äôs history.

The Crab Nebula is the result of a core-collapse supernova from the death of a massive star. The supernova explosion itself was seen on Earth in 1054 CE and was bright enough to view during the daytime. The much fainter remnant observed today is an expanding shell of gas and dust, and outflowing wind powered by a pulsar, a rapidly spinning and highly magnetized neutron star.

The Crab Nebula is also highly unusual. Its atypical composition and very low explosion energy previously have been explained by an electron-capture supernova ‚Äî a rare type of explosion that arises from a star with a less-evolved core made of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, rather than a more typical iron core.

@nasa joined the self-designated ‚Äúparty with a purpose‚Äù to let participants in the 30th @essencefest in New Orleans know there is space for everybody at the space agency.

NASA representatives from the agency‚Äôs Headquarters in Washington participated in a panel conversation about Black women in the aerospace industry and diversity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). NASA Assistant Deputy Associate Administrator for the Moon to Mars Program Office Lakiesha Hawkins and NASA Director of Engagement Aya Collins spoke to fest participants during the Take Up Space (Literally) presentation on July 5.

On both July 5-6, representatives from NASA Headquarters and NASA Stennis also hosted an interactive booth at the Audubon Aquarium near the festival meeting site. The representatives shared about NASA‚Äôs Artemis campaign and NASA Stennis‚Äô role as America‚Äôs largest rocket propulsion test site. With the Artemis campaign, NASA will land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon, using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before.

NASA representatives at the Audubon Aquarium provided attendees with memorabilia and an immersive experience to the @iss, which serves as the world‚Äôs leading space laboratory. Astronauts aboard the space station are conducting cutting-edge research and technology development to support human and robotic exploration of destinations beyond low Earth orbit, including the Moon and Mars.

The annual ESSENCE Fest attracts hundreds of thousands of people to New Orleans during the Fourth of July weekend to celebrate the Black community. The NASA outreach and engagement effort continues the agency‚Äôs commitment to advance equity and reach deeper into underrepresented and underserved segments of society as NASA explores the secrets of the universe for the benefit of all.

Its center is the brightest and whiter. There are four diffraction spikes forming an X atop its gauzy blue layers. At right is NGC 2936, nicknamed the Penguin. Its beak-like region points toward and above the Egg. Where the eye would be is a small, opaque yellow spiral. The Penguin‚Äôs distorted arms form the bird‚Äôs beak, back, and tail. The tail is wide and layered, like a beta fish‚Äôs tail. A semi-transparent blue hue traces the Penguin and extends from the galaxy, creating an upside-down U overtop both galaxies. At top right is another galaxy seen from the side, pointing roughly at a 45-degree angle. It is largely light blue. Its length appears approximately as long as the Egg‚Äôs height. One foreground star with large, bright blue diffraction spike appear overtop the galaxy and another near it. The entire background is filled with tiny, extremely distant galaxies. The background of space is black.

To celebrate the second science anniversary of NASA‚Äôs James Webb Space Telescope, the team has released a near- and mid-infrared image on July 12, 2024, of two interacting galaxies: The Penguin and the Egg.

The distorted spiral galaxy at center, the Penguin, and the compact elliptical at left, the Egg, are locked in an active embrace. This near- and mid-infrared image combines data from NASA‚Äôs James Webb Space Telescope‚Äôs NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument), and marks the telescope‚Äôs second year of science. Webb‚Äôs view shows that their interaction is marked by a glow of scattered stars represented in blue. Known jointly as Arp 142, the galaxies made their first pass by one another between 25 and 75 million years ago, causing ‚Äúfireworks,‚Äù or new star formation, in the Penguin. The galaxies are approximately the same mass, which is why one hasn‚Äôt consumed the other.

What are these unusual interstellar structures? Bright-rimmed, flowing shapes gather near the center of this rich starfield toward the borders of the nautical southern constellations Pupis and Vela. Composed of interstellar gas and dust, the grouping of light-year sized cometary globules is about 1300 light-years distant. Energetic ultraviolet light from nearby hot stars has molded the globules and ionized their bright rims. The globules also stream away from the Vela supernova remnant which may have influenced their swept-back shapes. Within them, cores of cold gas and dust are likely collapsing to form low mass stars, whose formation will ultimately cause the globules to disperse. In fact, cometary globule CG 30 (on the upper left) sports a small reddish glow near its head, a telltale sign of energetic jets from a star in the early stages of formation.

Heckin‚Äô Good Puppis

This roiling cauldron of gas and dust clouds sprinkled with bright blue hot young stars is NGC 2467. It was discovered in the nineteenth century and lies in the southern constellation of Puppis ‚Äì not to be confused with the word ‚Äúpuppies,‚Äù even though they sound pretty similar ‚Äì and is thought to be located about 13,000 light-years from Earth.

This star-forming region is a vast cloud of gas ‚Äì mostly hydrogen ‚Äì that serves as an incubator for new stars. Some of these youthful stars are peeking out from the dense clouds where they were born, but many others remain hidden. Those stars emit fierce ultraviolet radiation that causes the whole scene to glow while also sculpting the environment and gradually eroding the gas clouds. Studies have shown that most of the radiation comes from the single hot and brilliant massive star just above the center of this near-infrared image captured by @NASAHubble.

Image description: Bright blue stars are scattered across a dense field of orange and yellow clouds of gas and dust. Some of the stars shine very brightly and have four diffraction spikes, while others are a bit dimmer. Very little of the darkness of space can be seen through the clouds.

Tired of FM and AM? Try tuning into a radio (wave) from your favorite star!

On July 9, the CubeSat Radio Interferometry Experiment, CURIE, was launched on ESA‚Äôs Ariane 6 to investigate the unresolved origins of radio waves coming from the Sun.

Scientists determined that these radio waves come from solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), but they‚Äôre unsure of their origin within the CME.

To get to know this experiment better, we first have to know what a CME is! When these eruptions happen inside the Sun‚Äôs outer atmosphere, called the corona, the magnetic field and plasma, or electrified gas, present in the Sun bubble up and sometimes burst, ejecting matter at incredibly high speeds. 

The ejected solar material then shoots through space, affecting other planets and spacecraft in its path. CMEs are also a driver of space weather, which can disrupt satellite communications and technology at Earth. 

Image description: A dark red and bright orange Sun dominates the right and center thirds of the image, with a particularly bright yellow spot on the left edge. Just below this bright spot is a thick, whiplike arch of solar mass that extends outward and downward to the left and loops back around the edge of the Sun.

‚ÄúOne small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.‚Äù - Astronaut Neil Armstrong
 
Fifty-five years ago today, America captured the world‚Äôs attention when our Apollo 11 mission landed on the Moon and astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first to walk on the lunar surface.
 
Today we are reminded how @NASA changed the world during the early era of space exploration. As we look toward the future and prepare for @NASAArtemis astronauts to take the next steps on the Moon, we remember the courage of the Apollo astronauts and their scientific discovery that lit the way forward.
 
As the chair of the National Space Council, @VP Kamala Harris is propelling NASA forward ‚Äî not just to the Moon, but to explore Mars and beyond. We look to the next generation of scientists, engineers, and explorers to continue this legacy.

Fifty-five years ago today, humans were up there. üåï

On July 20, 1969, humans walked on another world for the first time in history ‚Äì our closest celestial neighbor, the Moon. In the words of #Apollo11 astronaut Neil Armstrong, it was ‚Äúone small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.‚Äù

An astronaut on the @ISS took this photo of the Moon in May 2024 when it was in the waxing crescent phase, with only a small sliver of the Sun-illuminated side visible on the right. The rest of the Moon glows more faintly by the light of the Sun after it has been reflected off of Earth‚Äîa phenomenon called earthshine. Below the Moon, Earth‚Äôs bright horizon, or limb, arcs across the bottom of the image. A cross-section of Earth‚Äôs atmospheric layers are visible, including the orange troposphere nearest to the surface and the thicker, light-blue stratosphere above that.

Since then, studying the Moon has continued to help us learn more about our home planet. The Moon offers clues as to how life on Earth may have begun, helps climate scientists understand Earth‚Äôs energy budget, and inspires us all.

‚ÄúMagnificent desolation.‚Äù

After launching aboard a Saturn V rocket from Launch Pad 39A on July 16, 1969, NASA astronauts Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., took humanity‚Äôs first steps on the lunar surface 55 years ago today.

Image description: Astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., lunar module pilot of the first lunar landing mission, poses for a photograph beside the deployed United States flag during Apollo 11 extravehicular activity (EVA) on the lunar surface. The Lunar Module (LM) is on the left, and the footprints of the astronauts are clearly visible in the soil of the moon. Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, commander, took this picture with a 70mm Hasselblad lunar surface camera. While astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin descended in the LM the ‚ÄúEagle‚Äù to explore the Sea of Tranquility region of the moon, astronaut Michael Collins, command module pilot, remained with the Command and Service Modules (CSM) ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù in lunar orbit.

Blowing bubbles in a stellar nursery

N44 is a complex nebula located in the Large Magellanic Cloud about 170,000 light-years from Earth. The nebula is filled with glowing hydrogen gas, dark lanes of dust, and countless stars of different ages. One of its most distinctive features, though, is the dark, starry "superbubble" seen near the top of this image captured by @NASAHubble.

The hole, which is about 250 light-years wide, is something of a mystery: it may have been created by stellar winds from the massive stars in the bubble's middle, or by the expanding shells of old supernovae.

Image description: This image of a distant nebula is filled with innumerable stars of different colors and sizes. Dust and gas overlay the photo in areas of greater and lesser density; near the top-center, though, a oval-shaped region of the image is virtually free of dust, allowing the stars within to shine through.

Simple yet complicated ‚ú®

Dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 5238‚Äôs blob-like appearance may appear lackluster at first glance, but with @NASAHubble, researchers can look for signs of whether NGC 5238 devoured a smaller satellite galaxy as recently as a billion years ago. 

A dwarf irregular galaxy like NGC 5238 merging with a smaller companion is the type of event that might have started the process of galaxy assembly in the early universe. Hubble‚Äôs observations can help test some of our most fundamental ideas of how the universe evolves! 

Image description:
A dwarf irregular galaxy. It appears as a cloud of bluish gas, filled with point-like stars that spread beyond the edge of the gas. A few glowing red clouds sit near its center. Many other objects are visible around it: distant galaxies in the background, four-pointed stars in the foreground, and star clusters that are part of the galaxy appear as bright spots surrounded by more tiny stars.

Astronauts on the @ISS snapped this photo of the waning gibbous moon on Nov. 30, 2023, as they orbited 262 miles above the Swiss Alps. The Moon enters the waning gibbous phase after the full moon phase. As the Moon begins its journey back toward the Sun, the lighted side appears to shrink, but the Moon‚Äôs orbit is simply carrying it out of view from our perspective.
 
While astronauts observe and photograph the Moon from space, you can do the same on Earth! Here are a few tips:
1. Planning is key ‚Äì scout out your photo location during the day, and practice using your camera.
2. Know when and where to look for the Moon (we have resources, hint hint).
3. Zoom in ‚Äì the Moon often looks much bigger to the eye than it does in photographs, so zoom in as much as you can, especially if you‚Äôre using a smartphone.

Check out more tips at https://go.nasa.gov/snapthemoon.
 
You can even hear from the pros: At 4:05 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, July 24, astronauts Don Pettit and Matthew Dominick will talk about astrophotography in low Earth orbit on our NASA X account (formerly Twitter).

On July 24, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins landed in the Pacific Ocean, wrapping up their eight-day mission to the Moon and back.

Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the Moon on July 20, walking on its surface for two-and-a-half hours; they collected 50 pounds (21.5 kg) of rocks and other lunar samples which we're still studying today. Apollo 11 was the first of six NASA missions to land on the Moon, paving the way for our Skylab missions, the space shuttle and the @ISS‚Äîand, ultimately, our @NASAArtemis missions for the long-term exploration of the Moon and Mars.

Image description: This photo features the Apollo 11 Command Module Columbia, a cone-shaped spacecraft with three large balloons on top, floating in the Pacific Ocean after splashdown. To its right and slightly behind it, the three members of the Apollo 11 crew sit in an oval-shaped liferaft wearing full-body isolation suits, supported by a U.S. Navy diver who is wearing a similar garment.
This is an actual photo of the coldest exoplanet ever directly imaged. It's about 12 light-years from Earth. 

Named Epsilon Indi Ac, the exoplanet has an estimated temperature of 35¬∫ F (2¬∫ C), which while around 180¬∫ F (100¬∫ C) warmer than gas giants in our solar system, is more similar to Jupiter than any other planet that has been imaged so far.

Previously imaged exoplanets tend to be young, hot exoplanets that are still radiating much of the energy from when they first formed. But as planets cool over their lifetime, they become significantly fainter and emit mostly mid-infrared light. @NASAWebb's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) is ideally suited for these kinds of detections, which provide a rare opportunity for astronomers to study the atmospheric composition of true solar system analogs.

NEW: Webb has snapped a shot of the coldest, most Jupiter-like exoplanet to be imaged so far. üì∏

The planet, called Epsilon Indi Ab, lies about 12 light-years away from Earth. To make the discovery, Webb blocked out starlight (shown by the star symbol) with a mask called a coronagraph.

Previously, directly imaged exoplanets were often the youngest, hottest worlds. As planets cool, they become significantly fainter and more difficult to image. Most of their emission is in mid-infrared light. Luckily, Webb is ideally suited to conduct mid-infrared imaging.

With an estimated temperature of 35 degrees F (2 degrees C), Epsilon Indi Ab is just a bit warmer than the gas giants in our own solar system. With its unique properties, this intriguing world is giving astronomers a rare opportunity to study a true solar system analog. More at our link in bio!

‚ÄúWere there clues I didn‚Äôt see? ‚Ä¶All along there was an invisible string.‚Äù

There is still little known about what makes up dark matter: ‚Äúthe invisible glue of the universe.‚Äù Understanding how it is distributed within a galaxy offers clues to how dark matter shapes the galaxy‚Äôs larger evolution.

Dark matter is about 27% of the universe‚Äôs mass, and even though it is invisible, scientists can observe it through its gravitational impact on observable objects. In the universe, scientists estimate there is more than five times as much dark matter as visible matter.

Computer simulations have suggested that dark matter should be piling up in galaxy centers, forming ‚Äúdensity cusps.‚Äù However, telescopic observations indicate that dark matter may be evenly distributed throughout galaxies. The conflicting observations and models continue to puzzle astronomers.

Dark matter stretches through the universe in filaments, where its gravity gathers clusters of galaxies. Because of the way it seems to be spread through galaxy clusters, scientists study other filament-based natural structures to understand growth along paths of least resistance.

One of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope‚Äôs duties is to explore the properties and effects of dark matter throughout the universe. As a new member of NASA‚Äôs team of telescopes, Roman‚Äôs mission will reflect the changing questions about our universe that NASA is exploring in the modern era.

Here's a look back 100 million years in time.

The light from galaxy NGC 3430 traveled that long to reach us, which means it's located 100 million light-years away!

This #HubbleFriday image shows a spiral galaxy with a bright core and a pinwheel array of arms that radiate outward, laced with dark dust lanes and blue patches of star formation.

Its distinct shape might be one reason why Hubble's namesake, the astronomer Edwin Hubble, used it to help define his classification of galaxies. A paper he published in 1926 outlined the classification of a few hundred galaxies by their appearance, as either spiral, barred spiral, lenticular, elliptical, or irregular.

This typology remained very influential. Today, astronomers classify NGC 3430 as a "SAc galaxy" ‚Äì meaning that it is a spiral galaxy without a central bar of stars, but with open and clearly defined arms.

Image description: A spiral galaxy with three prominent arms wrapping around it. The galaxy holds plenty of extra gas and dark dust between the arms. There are shining blue points throughout the arms and some patches of gas out beyond the galaxy‚Äôs edge, where stars are forming. The center of the galaxy also shines brightly. It is on a dark background where some small orange dots mark distant galaxies.

What‚Äôs on this reserve? üîé

At the far southern reaches of South America, the Costa Atl√°ntica Reserve in Argentina is a stretch of tidal flats, shoals, and beaches that serves as a refuge for migratory shorebirds and many forms of aquatic life. 

#Landsat 9 captured this image on February 20. The reserve extends for 140 miles along the eastern shore of Tierra del Fuego. Tidal habitats along the coast support about 135 species of birds, while crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and cetaceans feed in the coastal waters. 

The south coast of the San Sebasti√°n Bay is an important area for the red knot, a shorebird that migrates between southern Argentina and the Canadian Arctic. One particular red knot, B95, earned the nickname ‚ÄúMoonbird‚Äù because it is estimated to have flown the distance of the Earth to the Moon and halfway back during its exceptionally long life.

Image description: 
A satellite image of the Costa Atl√°ntica Reserve. The land and water meet on a diagonal line starting from the top right corner of the image. The Atlantic Ocean is on the right, with increasingly darker blue waters further away from land (toward the right side of the image). Tierra del Fuego is the land left of the diagonal. Near the top left corner, the diagonal is interrupted as the land curves inward, San Sebastian Bay. The waters of the bay are colored a light blue. The land appears in shades of green and brown. On the left of the image there are several white spots, which are clouds. In the bottom right corner of the image is R√≠o Grande.

Hubble captures infant stars transforming a nebula! This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image presents a visually striking collection of interstellar gas and dust. Named RCW 7, the nebula is located just over 5,300 light-years from Earth in the constellation Puppis.

Nebulae are areas rich in the raw material needed to form new stars. Under the influence of gravity, parts of these molecular clouds collapse until they coalesce into very young, developing stars, called protostars, which are still surrounded by spinning discs of leftover gas and dust. The protostars forming in RCW 7 are particularly massive, giving off strongly ionizing radiation and fierce stellar winds that transformed the nebula into a H II region.

In this #NASAStennisHistory image, NASA Stennis conducts the final test of a space shuttle main engine on July 29, 2009, on the center's A-2 Test Stand. The Space Shuttle Program concluded two years later with the STS-135 shuttle mission using the orbiter Atlantis, which launched on July 8, 2011, and landed 13 days later on July 21.

Three observatories tag-teamed to gather data for this spectacular image of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.

Hubble and @NASAWebb captured the galaxies seen clustered together, while @NASAChandraXRay detected the superheated gas that these galaxies are immersed in, seen in purple.

Held together by gravity, galaxy clusters like this one can contain hundreds or even thousands of individual galaxies. Each of those galaxies is home to millions or billions of stars!

Image description: This image shows the distant galaxy cluster known as MACS J0416. The blackness of space is packed with glowing dots and tiny shapes, in whites, purples, oranges, golds, and reds, each a distinct galaxy. Upon close inspection the spiraling arms of some of the seemingly tiny galaxies are revealed in this highly detailed image. Gently arched across the middle of the frame is a soft band of purple, which is a reservoir of superheated gas detected by Chandra.

To celebrate the 25th anniversary of its launch, NASA‚Äôs Chandra X-ray Observatory is releasing 25 never-before-seen views of a wide range of cosmic objects.These images, which all include data from Chandra, demonstrate how X-ray astronomy explores all corners of the universe. By combining X-rays from Chandra with other space-based observatories and telescopes on the ground, as many of these images do, astronomers can tackle the biggest questions and investigate long-standing mysteries across the cosmos.

On July 23, 1999, the space shuttle Columbia launched into orbit carrying Chandra, which was then the heaviest payload ever carried by the shuttle. With Commander Eileen Collins at the helm, the astronauts aboard Columbia successfully deployed Chandra into its highly elliptical orbit that takes it nearly one-third of the distance to the Moon.

The Crab Nebula is the result of a bright supernova explosion witnessed by Chinese and other astronomers in 1054 A.D. Chandra sees the rings around the pulsar and the jets blasting into space. X-rays from Chandra (blue-violet and white) and IXPE (purple); optical from Hubble (red, green, and blue)

Watashi wa star ‚ú®
 
This light-year-long knot of interstellar gas and dust that looks a little like a caterpillar is a newborn star ‚Äì a protostar.
 
Stars form in large clouds of gas and dust called molecular clouds. These massive clouds are cold and clump up. Eventually, gravity causes some of these clumps to collapse. When this happens, friction causes the material to heat up, eventually leading to the creation of a protostar.
 
A protostar hasn‚Äôt yet developed the energy-generating capabilities of a star like the Sun, which fuses hydrogen into helium in its core. Instead, a protostar‚Äôs energy comes from the heat released created by that initial collapse. In time, the protostar will develop the ability to generate energy like other Sun-like stars.
 
Image description: Many golden stars stud the darkness of space. Some of the stars have four diffraction spikes. At the center is a long, bright blue cloud of gas and dust with a bright core.

Pommel horse and equestrian events have us thinking of the Horsehead Nebula ‚Äì a medal-worthy shot from Hubble of a massive cloud of gas and dust. üê¥

Located about 1,600 light-years away, it's a popular target for amateur and professional astronomers alike.

Hubble observed the Horsehead in infrared light to capture this iconic image, used to mark the mission's 23rd anniversary back in 2013. The rich tapestry of nebula pops out prominently against some of our Milky Way Galaxy's stars and distant galaxies beyond our own, all easily visible in infrared light.

Image description: A massive cloud of gas and dust is seen in dark, dusty red, with its outer portions a translucent, ethereal gray. Several stars and distant galaxies are scattered throughout the image.

What's up in August? 

The Perseid meteor shower! The meteor shower peaks this month. Provided you have clear skies, viewing conditions will be favorable this year. The Perseids are best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere during the pre-dawn hours.
