Chilling out in Brazil ðŸŒŠ

Located to the east of Rio de Janeiro, Cabo Frio is Portuguese for "Cape Cold" â€” so named because the ocean that surrounds it is unusually chilly. Strong northeasterly winds that blow along Cabo Frio's coast push warm surface waters away from the shore, allowing cool water from deeper in the ocean to rise to the surface. This upwelled water is also rich in nutrients, helping feed the rich marine ecosystem off of Cabo Frio's shores.

This image of Cabo Frio was taken from space on September 16, 2023, by the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) instrument aboard Landsat 9, a partnership between NASA and @USGS. June 8 is #WorldOceansDay â€” follow @NASAEarth for more photos from around our home planet!

Image description: A lush, green cape, as seen from space. The bottom and right borders are filled with deep blue water, but the land and various lagoons take up the rest of the image. Developed areas fill the bottom-right corner of the visible land, and stretch out across the beaches and lagoon shores beyond.

Every day is #BestFriendsDay for Hubble!

For over three decades, Hubble has collaborated with other missions to get a more complete understanding of our universe.

From collaborating with telescopes like @NASAWebb to helping probes that explore our solar system, Hubble's unique vantage point above our atmosphere and ability to see in ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light have made it a valuable teammate to many missions.

This image shows the galaxy M82 with combined observations from Hubble (hydrogen emission and visible light), the Spitzer Space Telescope (infrared light), and @NASAChandraXRay (X-rays). 

Image description: The galaxy M82 shines in many colors against black space. A swathe of glowing, hazy green and yellow stretches across the center of the galaxy. Dark red filaments interspersed with glowing blue extend above and beneath it, surrounding a glowing pink central region.

Thatâ€™s us. Thatâ€™s home.

Itâ€™s #WorldOceansDay, so tell us, which ocean is your favorite?

We really canâ€™t pick one, but if we had to, it might be the Pacific! JPL resides in Southern California, after all. ðŸ˜Ž

ðŸ“¸ Image Description: A color image of the Earth obtained by the Galileo spacecraft early Dec. 12, 1990, when the spacecraft was about 1.6 million miles from the Earth. The color composite used images taken through the red, green and violet filters. The Pacific Ocean covers virtually all of the visible disk of the Earth in this picture. The glint of the Sun reflected from smooth water is near the center. This is a frame of the Galileo Earth spin movie, a 500-frame time-lapse motion picture showing a 25-hour period of Earths rotation and atmospheric dynamics.
Artemis II Update ðŸš€ 
 
NASA will roll the fully assembled core stage for the agencyâ€™s SLS (Space Launch System) rocket that will launch the first crewed #Artemis mission out of NASAâ€™s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans in mid-July. The 212-foot-tall stage will be loaded on the agencyâ€™s Pegasus barge for delivery to Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Here, the core stage is currently behind scaffolding to allow work to continue at NASAâ€™s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. The stageâ€™s two massive propellant tanks hold a collective 733,000 gallons of liquid propellant to power the four RS-25 engines at its base. Following hardware acceptance reviews and final checkouts, the stage will be readied for delivery.
