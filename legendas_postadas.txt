Located to the east of Rio de Janeiro, Cabo Frio is Portuguese for "Cape Cold" ‚Äî so named because the ocean that surrounds it is unusually chilly. Strong northeasterly winds that blow along Cabo Frio's coast push warm surface waters away from the shore, allowing cool water from deeper in the ocean to rise to the surface. This upwelled water is also rich in nutrients, helping feed the rich marine ecosystem off of Cabo Frio's shores.

This image of Cabo Frio was taken from space on September 16, 2023, by the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) instrument aboard Landsat 9, a partnership between NASA and @USGS. June 8 is #WorldOceansDay ‚Äî follow @NASAEarth for more photos from around our home planet!

Every day is #BestFriendsDay for Hubble!

For over three decades, Hubble has collaborated with other missions to get a more complete understanding of our universe.

From collaborating with telescopes like @NASAWebb to helping probes that explore our solar system, Hubble's unique vantage point above our atmosphere and ability to see in ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light have made it a valuable teammate to many missions.

@Boeing‚Äôs Starliner pulls into the orbital driveway of the International Space Station (@ISS) carrying two @NASAAstronauts aboard, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. This is the spacecraft‚Äôs Crew Flight Test, which is testing the end-to-end capabilities of the spacecraft from liftoff to docking and the return to Earth.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
After successfully launching on June 5 at 10:52 a.m. EDT (1452 UTC), the crew docked to the space station on June 6 at 1:34 p.m. EDT (1734 UTC). This was the first time humans have gone to space aboard a @ULAlaunch Atlas V rocket, and the first time astronauts launched on an Atlas-family class rocket since Gordon Cooper on the last Mercury program flight aboard Faith 7 in May 1963. It‚Äôs the same kind of rocket that launched the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers to Mars.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
This is the first time in station history we‚Äôve had three different spacecraft that carried crew to the orbiting lab docked at the same time. Even after more than 25 years of operation, we‚Äôre still experiencing so many exciting firsts. ‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Stay tuned to nasa.gov/live over the next week for broadcast details on the many activities our astronauts will be up to on the orbital lab as they prepare for their return home.‚Å£

‚ÄòSuper‚Äô star cluster shines in new look from NASA‚Äôs Chandra! Westerlund 1 is the biggest and closest ‚Äúsuper‚Äù star cluster to Earth. New data from NASA‚Äôs Chandra X-ray Observatory, in combination with other NASA telescopes, is helping astronomers delve deeper into this galactic factory where stars are vigorously being produced.

This new image shows the new deep Chandra data along with previously released data from NASA‚Äôs Hubble Space Telescope. The X-rays detected by Chandra show young stars (mostly represented as white and pink) as well as diffuse heated gas throughout the cluster (colored pink, green, and blue, in order of increasing temperatures for the gas). Many of the stars picked up by Hubble appear as yellow and blue dots.

Oh, Neptune.

Our Voyager 2 spacecraft captured this image of Neptune‚Äôs south pole as it sped away from the planet in 1989. Here‚Äôs one cool fact about Neptune‚Äôs south pole: it‚Äôs hotter than the rest of the planet by about 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit).

Voyager 2 has been in operation since 1977 and is the only spacecraft to have ever visited Uranus and Neptune. During its travels through the outer solar system, Voyager 2 visited all four gas giant planets, and discovered and photographed many of the planets' moons.

In November 2018, Voyager 2 reached interstellar space, the region between stars filled with material ejected by the death of nearby stars millions of years ago. Its twin spacecraft, Voyager 1, has resided in interstellar space since August 2012. Voyager 1 and 2 are now exploring where nothing from Earth has flown before. In their current mission, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, these two adventurers will explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain.

Forty years ago, a star burst onto the scene as a "nova" ‚Äì and we're still learning more from it.

This nova occurred when a burned-out star ingested gas from a bloated red giant companion that it orbits.

The star system, HM Sagittae, grew 250 times brighter, and has maintained that brightness for decades. However, Hubble's latest observations show that it's gotten hotter, but has paradoxically faded a little.

International Super(nova) Spy üïµÔ∏è

Webb has identified 10 times more supernovae in the early universe than previously known. Several are the most distant examples of their type, including those used to measure the universe's expansion rate.

As the universe expands, light gets stretched into longer (infrared) wavelengths over time. This is called redshift! Because their light has been traveling such great distances, and for so long, Webb‚Äôs powerful and sensitive infrared eye is ideal for observing far-off supernovae.

Before Webb, only a handful of supernovae above a redshift of 2 (corresponding to when the universe was 3.3 billion years old) had been found. Now Webb‚Äôs data sample includes dying stars that exploded when the universe was less than 2 billion years old, in its pre-teens. In total, Webb uncovered ~80 supernovae (circled here in green) in a patch of sky the thickness of a grain of rice held at arm‚Äôs length. Learn more at our link in bio!

Ring ring! @NASAWebb calling üëã

This image of the Southern Ring Nebula was one of the very first that the James Webb Space Telescope shared with the world back in 2022. Officially known as NGC 3132, the Southern Ring Nebula is a cloud of gas and dust surrounding a dying star 2,500 light-years from Earth.

With its high-resolution, infrared vision, Webb is able to peer through the dust to study the glimmering details within. Observations like these are helping astronomers understand the life and death of the stars that make up our galaxy‚Äîand Webb's just getting started.

Image description: A planetary nebula, seen by the Webb telescope's NIRCam instrument, against the blackness of space, with points of starlight behind it. The nebula itself is shaped like an irregular oval, with lacy, reddish orange plumes of gas and dust. Further inside the circle, the gas and dust glows bright blue. A glowing white ring separates the red and blue gases. In the center of the rings are two stars, one glowing much brighter than the other, with diffraction spikes radiating out from it.

NGC 4414 helped light the way! üí°

This dusty spiral galaxy was imaged in the 1990s by Hubble as part of the HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale. Astronomers examined this galaxy with Hubble 13 times over the course of two months, in order to best calculate its distance from Earth.

Based on careful brightness measurements of variable stars (stars that fluctuate in brightness) in NGC 4414, astronomers determined the galaxy is 60 million light-years away.

This information helped scientists understand more about the rate of the expansion of our universe, and teaches us more about the distance and size of many cosmic objects, and even the age of the universe itself.

NGC 4414's central regions contain yellow and red stars that are primarily older, which is common for spiral galaxies. The outer arms are considerably bluer in this #HubbleClassic view due to ongoing formation of young, blue stars.

Image description: A massive spiral galaxy fills the image. With a glowing yellow center, its spiral arms extend outward and are interlaced with dark brown dust  and hazy regions of stars, all against black space.

We heard you like black holes. Well, scientists using Chandra just studied more than 8,000 of them!‚ö´

A new X-ray study of over 8,000 rapidly growing black holes in a sample of 1.3 million galaxies, combined with state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations, has provided us with the best modeling to date of the growth of the supermassive black holes found in the centers of galaxies. More in the comments!

Visual Description:
On the left is an X-ray image from XMM-Newton combined with optical light. Pinpoints of light, mostly in shades of gold, blue, and green, are scattered over the black background of space. One point of blue light, a supermassive black hole, is outlined within an illustrated, gray square. The square has lines protruding to our right that connect it with an artist‚Äôs concept image of a black hole.

The X-ray and optical image on our left, the image containing the square, slowly dissolves as we move toward the right into an image of a supercomputer model of gas density across enormous distances. The model shows a multitude of teal-colored dots and filaments that are converging in some places, forming larger balls of teal-colored light. The patterns appear somewhat similar to the neural networks imaged in the brains of humans and other animals.

The window to the stars let in a particularly pretty pink glow this time!

NGC 3059, a spiral galaxy about 57 million light-years from Earth, was captured by @NASAHubble‚Äôs Wide Field Camera 3, through a narrow-band F657N filter, which focuses mostly on the wavelengths of light that show where pink-hued stars are beginning to form. Stars that emit this pinkish hue, 656.46 nanometers, are typically the younger stars in the galaxy. Using this filter helps astronomers study them.

This particular filter was assisted by five wide-band filters to gather the full spectrum of beauty and color present in this galaxy, while still emphasizing the pinkish stars.

The more filters used to capture an image, the more scientists get to explore any particular observation at different wavelengths, which can yield more observations than a single section of the electromagnetic spectrum captured by one filter in any single image.

The blue pockets, revealed only by the supplementary wide filters, show scientists where older stars may be tucked away in NGC 3059.

Image Description:
A barred spiral galaxy seen face-on. Its many arms and distinct, glowing, bar-shaped core are easily visible. The galaxy‚Äôs arms hold bluish patches of older stars, pink patches where new stars are forming, and dark threads of dust.

NASA astronaut Bill Anders took this iconic image of Earth rising over the Moon‚Äôs horizon on Dec. 24, 1968. Anders, lunar module pilot on the Apollo 8 mission, and fellow astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell became the first humans to orbit the Moon and the first to witness the sight pictured.

After becoming a fighter pilot in the Air Force, Anders was selected as an astronaut by NASA. He was backup pilot for the Gemini XI and Apollo 11 flights, and he was lunar module pilot for Apollo 8 ‚Äì the first lunar orbit mission in December 1968. Anders passed away on June 7, 2024.

Planets in progress!

How's this for #ThrowbackThursday? @NASA announced #OTD 30 years ago that Hubble discovered the strongest evidence yet that the planet-making process is common in our Milky Way Galaxy.

Hubble's observations, like the one in this image, reveal huge disks of dust (the raw material for planet formation) swirling around at least half of the stars in the Orion Nebula, a star-forming region only about 1,500 light-years from Earth.

These protoplanetary disks, or proplyds, surround young stars. It's believed our planet Earth, along with the rest of the planets in our solar system, formed in the same way about 4.5 billion years ago.

Thirty years later, astronomers believe that planetary systems like this are common in the universe. And because planets are necessary for life as we know it to become established, this raises the likelihood of the existence of life beyond Earth.

Image description: Hazy, glowing clouds of blue, gray, and pink fill the image. In the foreground, five blobs are protoplanetary disks. The largest is glowing pale orange at center. The others are smaller in size but similar in color, aside from the rightmost blob which is dark brown with a small, bright center.

Sometimes, taking a different route can be a good thing.

See what @NASA‚Äôs Perseverance Mars Rover discovered after changing course to avoid wheel-rattling boulders on its way to an area nicknamed Bright Angel. In crossing the dune field, the rover traversed an unexpected geological playground, Neretva Vallis, which is an ancient river channel that carried the majority of the water that flowed into Jezero Crater billions of years ago.

One particular rock caught the team‚Äôs interest. The light-toned and speckled boulder, nicknamed ‚ÄúAtoko Point,‚Äù is about 18 inches (45 cm) wide and 14 inches (35 cm) tall and stands out in a field of darker ones. Analysis by Perseverance‚Äôs SuperCam and Mastcam-Z instruments indicate that the rock is composed of the minerals pyroxene and feldspar, similar to boulders the rover has encountered elsewhere. But in terms of the size, shape, and arrangement of its mineral grains and crystals ‚Äî and potentially its chemical composition ‚Äî Atoko Point is in a league of its own. Some Perseverance scientists speculate that Atoko Point‚Äôs minerals were produced in a subsurface body of magma that is possibly exposed now on the crater rim. Others on the team wonder if the boulder had been created far beyond the walls of Jezero and transported there by the swift Martian waters eons ago. Either way, the team believes that while Atoko is the first of its kind they‚Äôve seen, it won‚Äôt be the last.

Perseverance is in the later stages of its fourth science campaign, looking for evidence of carbonate deposits in the ‚Äòmargin unit‚Äô along the inside of the crater rim.

Some give their children the world, others give them space. ‚≠ê Our Galileo spacecraft was named for a father of modern astronomy, Galileo Galilei. Galileo was the first mission to measure Jupiter‚Äôs atmosphere directly with a descent probe, and the first to conduct long-term observations of the jovian system from orbit. Galileo orbited Jupiter for almost eight years and made close passes by all its major moons. It found evidence of subsurface liquid layers of saltwater on Europa, Ganymede and Callisto and it examined a diversity of volcanic activity on Io. Its camera and nine other instruments sent back reports that allowed scientists to determine, among other things, that Jupiter‚Äôs icy moon Europa probably has a subsurface ocean with more water than the total amount found on Earth. They discovered that the volcanoes of the moon Io repeatedly and rapidly resurface the little world. They found that the giant moon Ganymede possesses its own magnetic field. Galileo even carried a small probe that it deployed and sent deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, taking readings for almost an hour before the probe was crushed by overwhelming pressure. Image description: A portion of Jupiter‚Äôs moon Ganymede is pictured in black-and-white.

On the oval‚Äôs exterior lie curtains of glowing yellow and green fluffy material. Its interior shell shows large-scale loops of mottled filaments of yellow-white and green, studded with clumps and knots. Translucent thin ribbons of smoky blue lie within the remnant‚Äôs interior, brightest toward its center. The blue material follows different directions throughout, including sometimes sharply curving away from certain regions within the remnant. A faint, wispy ring of blue material encircles the very center of the nebula. Around and within the supernova remnant are many points of blue, green, purple, and white light.

President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, but news did not reach Confederate-controlled Galveston until April 1865, when Union troops arrived to inform the people of Texas that all enslaved people were free. As news of General Order No. 3 (issued June 19) spread, spontaneous celebrations broke out in African American churches, homes, and other gathering places. Over time, these June 19th celebrations became more formalized, becoming annual Juneteenth celebrations.

The stars, they aligned üé∂
¬†
See how those bright red, clumpy streaks in the top left are all slanted in the same direction to the same degree? They show aligned protostellar outflows, or jets of gas from newborn stars. @NASAWebb captures this phenomenon for the first time.
¬†
‚ÄúAstronomers have long assumed that as clouds collapse to form stars, the stars will tend to spin in the same direction,‚Äù said principal investigator Klaus Pontoppidan of @NASAJPL. ‚ÄúHowever, this has not been seen so directly before. These aligned, elongated structures are a historical record of the fundamental way that stars are born.‚Äù
¬†
Previously, the objects appeared as blobs or were invisible in optical wavelengths. Webb‚Äôs sensitive infrared vision was able to pierce through the thick dust, resolving the stars and their outflows.
¬†
This area is part of the Serpens Nebula. Located 1,300 light-years from Earth, it‚Äôs only 1-2 million years old ‚Äî very young in cosmic terms! It‚Äôs home to a dense cluster of newly forming stars (about 100,000 years old), seen at the center of this image.

Surrounding the octopus-like structure is a cloud of material in shades of red that is wider horizontally than it is vertically. A ribbon of purple material extends to the left edge of the red cloud, curling upward at its conclusion. Another purple ribbon extends to the right edge of the red cloud, though it is less defined than the one on the other side. Stars of many shapes and sizes dot the entire image.

The stars, they aligned üé∂
¬†
See how those bright red, clumpy streaks in the top left are all slanted in the same direction to the same degree? They show aligned protostellar outflows, or jets of gas from newborn stars. @NASAWebb captures this phenomenon for the first time.
¬†
‚ÄúAstronomers have long assumed that as clouds collapse to form stars, the stars will tend to spin in the same direction,‚Äù said principal investigator Klaus Pontoppidan of @NASAJPL. ‚ÄúHowever, this has not been seen so directly before. These aligned, elongated structures are a historical record of the fundamental way that stars are born.‚Äù
¬†
Previously, the objects appeared as blobs or were invisible in optical wavelengths. Webb‚Äôs sensitive infrared vision was able to pierce through the thick dust, resolving the stars and their outflows.
¬†
This area is part of the Serpens Nebula. Located 1,300 light-years from Earth, it‚Äôs only 1-2 million years old ‚Äî very young in cosmic terms! It‚Äôs home to a dense cluster of newly forming stars (about 100,000 years old), seen at the center of this image.

Image description: A young star-forming region is filled with wispy orange, red, and blue layers of gas and dust. The upper left corner of the image is filled with mostly orange dust, and within that orange dust, there are several small red plumes of gas that extend from the top left to the bottom right, at the same angle. The center of the image is filled with mostly blue gas. At the center, there is one particularly bright star, that has an hourglass shadow above and below it. To the right of that is what looks a vertical eye-shaped crevice with a bright star at the center. The gas to the right of the crevice is a darker orange. Small points of light are sprinkled across the field, brightest sources in the field have extensive eight-pointed diffraction spikes that are characteristic of the Webb Telescope.

Top of Solstice ü™ê 

It's Earth's solstice today, but Saturn's Northern Hemisphere reached its summer solstice in mid-2017, bringing continuous sunshine to the planet's far north. The Cassini mission used the unparalleled opportunity to observe changes that occur on the planet as the Saturnian seasons turn.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 17 degrees above the ring plane. The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 17, 2017 using a spectral filter which preferentially admits wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 939 nanometers.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 733,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Saturn. Image scale is 44 miles (70 kilometers) per pixel.

NASA‚Äôs Chandra peers into densest and weirdest stars! The supernova remnant 3C 58 contains a spinning neutron star, known as PSR J0205+6449, at its center. Astronomers studied this neutron star and others like it to probe the nature of matter inside these very dense objects. A new study, made using NASA‚Äôs Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESA‚Äôs XMM-Newton, reveals that the interiors of neutron stars may contain a type of ultra-dense matter not found anywhere else in the Universe.

In this image of 3C 58, low-energy X-rays are colored red, medium-energy X-rays are green, and the high-energy band of X-rays is shown in blue. The X-ray data have been combined with an optical image in yellow from the Digitized Sky Survey. The Chandra data show that the rapidly rotating neutron star (also known as a ‚Äúpulsar‚Äù) at the center is surrounded by a torus of X-ray emission and a jet that extends for several light-years. The optical data shows stars in the field.

Phobos is the larger of Mars' two moons‚Äîbut it's still only about 17 x 14 x 11 miles (27 by 22 by 18 kilometers) in diameter. Because Phobos is so small, its gravity isn't strong enough to pull it into a sphere (like Earth's Moon), giving it its lumpy shape.

Phobos is also on a collision course with Mars‚Äîthough it'll take a while to get there. It's nearing the Red Planet at a rate of six feet (1.8 meters) every hundred years. At that rate, the moon will either crash into Mars in 50 million years or break up into a ring. 

This image was taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on our Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been studying Mars since 2006.

Image description: The Martian moon Phobos stands against the darkness of space. The moon is brownish-red and lumpy, pocketed with a number of craters of all sizes. A white patch is visible next to Stickney crater, a particularly large crater on its right side.

Cloudy with a chance of new stars! üåü

Named RCW 7, the nebula in this #HubbleFriday view contains the gas and dust needed to form stars. Under the influence of gravity, parts of the nebula's clouds collapse until they coalesce into very young, developing stars ‚Äì called protostars!

The protostars in RCW 7 are huge, giving off fierce stellar winds and radiation that are transforming the nebula into something called a H II region.

These regions are full of hydrogen ions. Ultraviolet radiation from the massive protostars excites the hydrogen in the nebula, causing it to emit light.

RCW 7 is located about 5,300 light-years away in the constellation Puppis. Find out more at the link in our bio!

Image description: Clouds of gas and dust with many stars. The clouds form a flat, blue background toward the bottom, and become thicker and smokier toward the top. Stars on one side light the nebula. A thick arc of gas and dust reaches around from the bottom-right corner of the image toward the top-left corner. It begins as a dark and obscuring cloud at bottom right and gradually becomes brightly lit by many stars at the upper left. Other large, foreground stars lie between the nebula and the viewer.

We‚Äôre investigating the origins of the Crab Nebula üîç

Scientists used @NASAWebb to explore what makes up the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant located 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Taurus. 

The Crab Nebula is rare, and researchers previously believed it had formed from a core made of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, rather than the more common iron core. However, Webb‚Äôs new data offers new interpretations of how this nebula came to be.

Image Description:
The Crab Nebula. An oval with a complex structure extends from lower left to upper right against a black background. On the oval‚Äôs exterior lie curtains of glowing yellow and green fluffy material. Its interior shell shows large-scale loops with mottled filaments of yellow-white and green, studded with clumps and knots. Translucent thin ribbons of smoky blue lie within the Crab Nebula‚Äôs interior, brightest toward its center. The blue material follows different directions throughout, including sometimes sharply curving away from certain regions. A faint, wispy ring of blue material encircles the very center of the nebula. Around and within the supernova remnant are many points of blue, green, purple, and white light.

First of its kind detection made in striking new Webb image! In this image of the Serpens Nebula from NASA‚Äôs James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers found a grouping of aligned protostellar outflows within one small region (the top left corner). Serpens is a reflection nebula, which means it‚Äôs a cloud of gas and dust that does not create its own light, but instead shines by reflecting the light from stars close to or within the nebula.

This sea ice is taking a spin down the coast üåä

Floating fragments of sea ice formed intricate patterns as ocean currents carried them south along Greenland‚Äôs east coast in spring 2024. 

Captured on June 4, this movement of sea ice and freshwater out of the Arctic is a component of ocean circulation patterns that distribute heat around the planet. The so-called ‚Äúglobal ocean conveyor belt‚Äù transports cold water south and warm water north, contributing to climate conditions worldwide. Sea ice has been declining in recent decades, affecting its ability to cool the planet.

Image Description:
A satellite image of Greenland‚Äôs east coast shows white floating fragments of sea ice spun into intricate swirls against a midnight blue ocean. Larger floes appear closer to the shoreline. Fast ice, which is ice anchored to the shore or shallow ocean bottom, is visible at the top of the image and along other sections of the coast. Along the upper left edge of the image, Greenland is visible, with brown rocks peeking through white snow.

Rhapsody in blue üé∂

This cosmic nebula, a cloud of gas and dust where new stars are born, was spotted by our orbiting @NASAHubble telescope. Located just over 5,300 light-years from Earth, this nebula is home to a number of young, developing stars called protostars, which show up as some of the smaller sparkles in this image.

The Hubble data in this image came from the telescope's Wide Field Camera 3, which peered through the nebula's cocoon of gas with near-infrared vision to study the stars within. This particular nebula is rich with hydrogen ions which are excited by the ultraviolet radiation coming from the nebula's protostars, giving it the pinkish glow seen here.

Image description: A dreamlike stellar landscape, with a pinkish arc of gas standing out against dark blue swirls. A number of stars of various sizes, each accentuated by four diffraction spikes, are abundantly scattered through the image.

This nebula‚Äôs baby stars may spell its rapid end‚Ä¶in a few million years.

The nebula RCW 7 is a collection of gas and dust that appears within the Puppis constellation. Parts of this star-forming nebula, or molecular cloud, have collapsed under gravity and formed into very young, developing stars known as protostars. RCW 7‚Äôs protostars are very massive, and give off strongly ionizing radiation and fierce stellar winds that have transformed the nebula into something called a H II region.

Captured in this photo by @NasaHubble, these new stars emit ultraviolet radiation that excites the hydrogen clouds in the nebula, causing the emission of pinkish light.

The formation of an H II region marks the beginning of the end for a molecular cloud like RCW 7. Within only a few million years, radiation and winds from the massive stars will gradually disperse the nebula‚Äôs gas ‚Äî even more so as the most massive stars come to the end of their lives in supernova explosions. New stars in this nebula will incorporate only a fraction of the nebula‚Äôs gas, the rest will spread throughout the galaxy to eventually form new molecular clouds.

The Hubble data in this image came from the study of a particularly massive protostellar binary named IRAS 07299-1651, still in its glowing cocoon of gas in the curling clouds toward the top of the image. To expose this star and its siblings, astronomers used Hubble‚Äôs Wide Field Camera 3 in near-infrared light.

Image Description

Clouds of gas and dust with many stars. The clouds form a flat, blue background toward the bottom, and become thicker and smokier toward the top. Stars on one side light the nebula. A thick arc of gas and dust reaches around from the bottom-right corner of the image toward the top-left corner. It begins as a dark and obscuring cloud at bottom right and gradually becomes brightly lit by many stars at the upper left. Other large, foreground stars lie between the nebula and the viewer.

Hubble views the lights of a galactic bar! This image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows the broad and sweeping spiral galaxy NGC 4731. It lies in the constellation Virgo and is located 43 million light-years from Earth. This highly detailed image uses data collected from six different filters. The abundance of color illustrates the galaxy's billowing clouds of gas, dark dust bands, bright pink star-forming regions and, most obviously, the long, glowing bar with trailing arms.

Barred spiral galaxies outnumber both regular spirals and elliptical galaxies put together, numbering around 60% of all galaxies. The visible bar structure is a result of orbits of stars and gas in the galaxy lining up, forming a dense region that individual stars move in and out of over time. This is the same process that maintains a galaxy's spiral arms, but it is somewhat more mysterious for bars: spiral galaxies seem to form bars in their centers as they mature, which helps explain the large number of bars we see today, but they can also lose them if the accumulated mass along the bar grows unstable.

@nasa successfully launched the fourth and final satellite in a series of advanced weather satellites for @noaa (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) at 4:26 p.m. CDT Tuesday, June 25. The GOES-U (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) will benefit the nation by providing continuous coverage of weather and hazardous environmental conditions across much of the Western Hemisphere.

The satellite launched on a @spacex Falcon Heavy rocket from Launch Complex 39A at @nasakennedy in Florida. Mission managers confirmed at 9:18 p.m. CDT on June 25 the spacecraft‚Äôs solar arrays successfully deployed, and the spacecraft was operating on its own power.

In addition to its critical role in terrestrial weather prediction, the GOES constellation of satellites helps forecasters predict space weather near Earth that can interfere with satellite electronics, GPS, and radio communications. The GOES-U satellite goes beyond the capabilities of its predecessors with a new space weather instrument, the Compact Coronograph-1, which blocks the Sun‚Äôs bright light so scientists can observe the relatively fainter solar atmosphere.

Once GOES-U is in a geostationary orbit, about 22,200 miles above Earth, it will be renamed GOES-19. Following a successful orbital checkout of its instruments and systems, GOES-19 will go into service, keeping watch of the weather over most of North America, including the contiguous United States and Mexico, as well as Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west coast of Africa.

@nasagoddard in Greenbelt, Maryland, oversaw the acquisition of the GOES-R series spacecraft and instruments and built the magnetometer for GOES-U and its predecessor, GOES-T. NASA‚Äôs Launch Services Program, based at Kennedy, provided launch management for the mission.

The GOES-R Series Program is overseen by NOAA, through an integrated NOAA-NASA office that manages the ground system, operates the satellites, and distributes data to users worldwide. @lockheedmartin designs, builds, and tests the GOES-R series satellites. @l3harristech provides the main instrument payload, the Advanced Baseline Imager, and the ground system.

Go with the floe üßä

These swirling ice floes are spinning off the shore of Greenland, as seen in this photo taken from space on June 4, 2024. Sea ice from the Arctic drifts down the Fram Strait, a 450-kilometer (280-mile)-wide passage that connects the Arctic Ocean with the Greenland Sea. Along the way, it breaks into smaller pieces and starts to melt in warmer ocean waters, creating the smoke-like swirls seen here.

In recent years, more of the Arctic Ocean's sea ice has become too young and thin to make the journey south. The movement of sea ice and freshwater out of the Arctic is part of the ocean circulation patterns that distribute heat around the planet, contributing to climate conditions worldwide ‚Äî so scientists are keeping a close eye on how these floes flow.

Follow @NASAEarth for more updates from across our home planet.

You‚Äôre the sunflower üéµ

Millions of light-years away in the small, northern constellation Canes Venatici, the spiral Sunflower galaxy (Messier 63) spreads its many arms ‚Äì or so it seems. The Sunflower galaxy is a flocculent spiral galaxy. That means its spiral arms aren‚Äôt well defined, so it looks like there are many that appear to be winding around its yellow core. In reality, there are just two. The arms shine bright thanks to recently formed, blue‚Äìwhite giant stars.

Star formation is one of the most important processes in shaping the universe. In addition to birthing new stars, it gives rise to planetary systems and plays a pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies. Scientists don‚Äôt fully know how stars form in flocculent spiral galaxies, so Messier 63 is a perfect one to study with images like this one from @nasahubble.

Image description: Slightly right of center, the galaxy‚Äôs core glows in yellow. The galaxy‚Äôs arms spiral outward from the core, filling the image with blue-tinged gas and dust. There are bright blue dots studded throughout these spiral arms; these are young blue-white giant stars. Very little of the darkness of space can be seen in this image, except at the very bottom.

NASA‚Äôs Mars Odyssey captures huge volcano, nears 100,000 orbits! NASA‚Äôs longest-lived Mars robot is about to mark a new milestone on June 30: 100,000 trips around the Red Planet since launching 23 years ago. During that time, the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter has been mapping minerals and ice across the Martian surface, identifying landing sites for future missions, and relaying data to Earth from NASA‚Äôs rovers and landers.

Scientists recently used the orbiter‚Äôs camera to take a stunning new image of Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system. The image is part of a continuing effort by the Odyssey team to provide high-altitude views of the planet‚Äôs horizon. (The first of these views was published in late 2023.) Similar to the perspective of Earth astronauts get aboard the International Space Station, the view enables scientists to learn more about clouds and airborne dust at Mars.

Surprising phosphate finding in NASA‚Äôs OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample! Early analysis of the asteroid Bennu sample returned by NASA‚Äôs OSIRIS-REx mission has revealed dust rich in carbon, nitrogen, and organic compounds, all of which are essential components for life as we know it. Dominated by clay minerals, particularly serpentine, the sample mirrors the type of rock found at mid-ocean ridges on Earth. The magnesium-sodium phosphate found in the sample hints that the asteroid could have splintered off from an ancient, small, primitive ocean world. The phosphate was a surprise to the team because the mineral had not been detected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft while at Bennu.

In this image, a tiny fraction of the asteroid Bennu sample returned by NASA‚Äôs OSIRIS-REx mission, is shown in microscope images. The top-left pane shows a dark Bennu particle, about a millimeter long, with an outer crust of bright phosphate. The other three panels show progressively zoomed-in views of a fragment of the particle that split off along a bright vein containing phosphate, captured by a scanning electron microscope.
