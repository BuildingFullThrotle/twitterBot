Chilling out in Brazil üåä

Located to the east of Rio de Janeiro, Cabo Frio is Portuguese for "Cape Cold" ‚Äî so named because the ocean that surrounds it is unusually chilly. Strong northeasterly winds that blow along Cabo Frio's coast push warm surface waters away from the shore, allowing cool water from deeper in the ocean to rise to the surface. This upwelled water is also rich in nutrients, helping feed the rich marine ecosystem off of Cabo Frio's shores.

This image of Cabo Frio was taken from space on September 16, 2023, by the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) instrument aboard Landsat 9, a partnership between NASA and @USGS. June 8 is #WorldOceansDay ‚Äî follow @NASAEarth for more photos from around our home planet!

Every day is #BestFriendsDay for Hubble!

For over three decades, Hubble has collaborated with other missions to get a more complete understanding of our universe.

From collaborating with telescopes like @NASAWebb to helping probes that explore our solar system, Hubble's unique vantage point above our atmosphere and ability to see in ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light have made it a valuable teammate to many missions.

That‚Äôs us. That‚Äôs home.

It‚Äôs #WorldOceansDay, so tell us, which ocean is your favorite?

We really can‚Äôt pick one, but if we had to, it might be the Pacific! JPL resides in Southern California, after all. üòé

üì∏ Image Description: A color image of the Earth obtained by the Galileo spacecraft early Dec. 12, 1990, when the spacecraft was about 1.6 million miles from the Earth. The color composite used images taken through the red, green and violet filters. The Pacific Ocean covers virtually all of the visible disk of the Earth in this picture. The glint of the Sun reflected from smooth water is near the center. This is a frame of the Galileo Earth spin movie, a 500-frame time-lapse motion picture showing a 25-hour period of Earths rotation and atmospheric dynamics.
Artemis II Update üöÄ 
 
NASA will roll the fully assembled core stage for the agency‚Äôs SLS (Space Launch System) rocket that will launch the first crewed #Artemis mission out of NASA‚Äôs Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans in mid-July. The 212-foot-tall stage will be loaded on the agency‚Äôs Pegasus barge for delivery to Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Here, the core stage is currently behind scaffolding to allow work to continue at NASA‚Äôs Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. The stage‚Äôs two massive propellant tanks hold a collective 733,000 gallons of liquid propellant to power the four RS-25 engines at its base. Following hardware acceptance reviews and final checkouts, the stage will be readied for delivery.

@Boeing‚Äôs Starliner pulls into the orbital driveway of the International Space Station (@ISS) carrying two @NASAAstronauts aboard, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. This is the spacecraft‚Äôs Crew Flight Test, which is testing the end-to-end capabilities of the spacecraft from liftoff to docking and the return to Earth.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
After successfully launching on June 5 at 10:52 a.m. EDT (1452 UTC), the crew docked to the space station on June 6 at 1:34 p.m. EDT (1734 UTC). This was the first time humans have gone to space aboard a @ULAlaunch Atlas V rocket, and the first time astronauts launched on an Atlas-family class rocket since Gordon Cooper on the last Mercury program flight aboard Faith 7 in May 1963. It‚Äôs the same kind of rocket that launched the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers to Mars.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
This is the first time in station history we‚Äôve had three different spacecraft that carried crew to the orbiting lab docked at the same time. Even after more than 25 years of operation, we‚Äôre still experiencing so many exciting firsts. ‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Stay tuned to nasa.gov/live over the next week for broadcast details on the many activities our astronauts will be up to on the orbital lab as they prepare for their return home.‚Å£

‚ÄòSuper‚Äô star cluster shines in new look from NASA‚Äôs Chandra! Westerlund 1 is the biggest and closest ‚Äúsuper‚Äù star cluster to Earth. New data from NASA‚Äôs Chandra X-ray Observatory, in combination with other NASA telescopes, is helping astronomers delve deeper into this galactic factory where stars are vigorously being produced.

This new image shows the new deep Chandra data along with previously released data from NASA‚Äôs Hubble Space Telescope. The X-rays detected by Chandra show young stars (mostly represented as white and pink) as well as diffuse heated gas throughout the cluster (colored pink, green, and blue, in order of increasing temperatures for the gas). Many of the stars picked up by Hubble appear as yellow and blue dots.

Oh, Neptune.

Our Voyager 2 spacecraft captured this image of Neptune‚Äôs south pole as it sped away from the planet in 1989. Here‚Äôs one cool fact about Neptune‚Äôs south pole: it‚Äôs hotter than the rest of the planet by about 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit).

Voyager 2 has been in operation since 1977 and is the only spacecraft to have ever visited Uranus and Neptune. During its travels through the outer solar system, Voyager 2 visited all four gas giant planets, and discovered and photographed many of the planets' moons.

In November 2018, Voyager 2 reached interstellar space, the region between stars filled with material ejected by the death of nearby stars millions of years ago. Its twin spacecraft, Voyager 1, has resided in interstellar space since August 2012. Voyager 1 and 2 are now exploring where nothing from Earth has flown before. In their current mission, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, these two adventurers will explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain.

Image description: This image is mostly black. The southern pole of Neptune is all that‚Äôs visible. It curves along the bottom of the image, like a smile. From left to right along the curve, the planet is blue, fading into a pale yellow.

Forty years ago, a star burst onto the scene as a "nova" ‚Äì and we're still learning more from it.

This nova occurred when a burned-out star ingested gas from a bloated red giant companion that it orbits.

The star system, HM Sagittae, grew 250 times brighter, and has maintained that brightness for decades. However, Hubble's latest observations show that it's gotten hotter, but has paradoxically faded a little.

Learn more about this #AAS result, just announced today, at the link in our bio.

Expedition 71 Flight Engineers (from left) Jeanette Epps and Mike Barratt assist Expedition 71 Flight Engineer Tracy C. Dyson, all three NASA astronauts, during a spacesuit fit check inside the International Space Station's Quest airlock.

NASA astronauts Tracy C. Dyson and Matt Dominick will exit the station‚Äôs Quest airlock on Thursday, June 13, to complete the removal of a faulty electronics box, called a radio frequency group, from a communications antenna on the starboard truss of the space station. The pair also will collect samples for analysis to understand the ability of microorganisms to survive and reproduce on the exterior of the orbiting laboratory.

International Super(nova) Spy üïµÔ∏è

Webb has identified 10 times more supernovae in the early universe than previously known. Several are the most distant examples of their type, including those used to measure the universe's expansion rate.

As the universe expands, light gets stretched into longer (infrared) wavelengths over time. This is called redshift! Because their light has been traveling such great distances, and for so long, Webb‚Äôs powerful and sensitive infrared eye is ideal for observing far-off supernovae.

Before Webb, only a handful of supernovae above a redshift of 2 (corresponding to when the universe was 3.3 billion years old) had been found. Now Webb‚Äôs data sample includes dying stars that exploded when the universe was less than 2 billion years old, in its pre-teens. In total, Webb uncovered ~80 supernovae (circled here in green) in a patch of sky the thickness of a grain of rice held at arm‚Äôs length. Learn more at our link in bio!
